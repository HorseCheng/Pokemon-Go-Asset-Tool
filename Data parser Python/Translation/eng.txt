Why do you insist on wasting my time?
You lack the gravitas to be in the presence of Team GO Rocket. I’ll finish this quickly.
Well, if you insist on battling, as a Trainer, I must accept. However, you will pay for inconveniencing me.
You have such an air of arrogance about you. Allow me to dispel it for you.
Your insolence disgusts me. I’ll make sure your confidence is utterly shattered following this battle.
Your sense of self-importance sickens me. Are you prepared to be wholly humiliated?
Your arrogance will be your downfall, and I shall be the one to set that in motion.
Loss is not a concept I’m acquainted with. I don’t expect that will change after this battle.
A person of your stature shouldn’t be this confident. Fret not—I’ll do you the honor of teaching you this lesson.
Usually I wouldn’t consider debasing myself by battling a commoner...but I’ll make an exception to humiliate you.
How...how can this be? I...I never lose!
How dare you...humiliate me like this?
I haven’t felt this much humiliation since I lost my battle with Candela... You’ll pay for this.
The last person to humiliate me like this was Candela. You’ll all pay for this...
I...I don’t understand... I never lose...
Oh? Are you here to challenge me? Don’t test me.
Pokémon are my tools, and winning is my birthright. Get in my way, and you’ll be crushed, vermin.
Are you the best that Candela and her little friends could find?
Tch... How dare riffraff such as yourself speak to me?
Only a fool would challenge me.
Team GO Rocket’s domination is inevitable. Submit and you may be spared.
Pokémon are our tools. We are entitled to power them up as we so choose. Commoners such as yourself would never understand.
My sole purpose in life is to win. I’ll vanquish whoever dares to get in my way.
Oh, do YOU think you can beat me? Someone of your standing? Hah!
What a fool you are to even think of battling me.
Don’t be too disappointed. It was always going to end like this.
I never lose. Now get out of my sight.
If this is the best Candela and her little friends can offer, Team GO Rocket has nothing to worry about.
If the rest of the Trainers of this world are like you, then Team GO Rocket’s success is assured.
It was foolish of you to think you could beat me. It’s because of my brilliance that we have Shadow Pokémon!

Building a bond with your buddy will earn you Perks—your buddy might be able to find Souvenirs, show you interesting places, get a CP boost, and more.
You’ll earn a heart for each {0} km you walk with your buddy up to {1} times per day. Walking distance is counted only while your buddy is walking with you on the map.
When your buddy is hungry, give it a treat. You can earn a heart once your buddy is full.
Playing with your buddy in AR mode will increase its happiness and can earn you a heart.
Battling in Gyms, in raids, against other Trainers, or against Team GO Rocket with your buddy in your battle party will strengthen your bond and can earn you a heart.
Capturing memories with your buddy by taking snapshots will strengthen your bond and can earn you a heart. Be sure to take your snapshot via the buddy screen!
While your buddy is following you, spin a PokéStop or Gym you haven’t visited before, and you can earn a heart.
Your buddy will give you presents and Souvenirs and discover various things during your adventure together. As a result, your bond will grow, and you can earn hearts as a bonus.

Prepare yourself for a world of pain.
I’d say to prepare for battle, but you have already lost.
Humble yourself. You are facing the world’s greatest Trainer.
If you insist on disrupting my plans, I will insist on making you regret it.
You have no idea who you are challenging, child.
You underestimate Team GO Rocket. Prepare for battle.
There is no stopping my plans.
Two things are inevitable: my success and your failure.
You have proven yourself by reaching me, so I shall spare you a moment of my time.
You may have made it here, but this is as far as you’ll go.
What?! This can’t be!
Your love of Pokémon gave you the advantage...this time.
... ... ...I shall step aside this time!
This defeat is meaningless. Team GO Rocket will never fall!
This isn’t over. We will meet on the battlefield again.
I must say—I am impressed you got here.
What’s this now? I hope you are a worthy opponent.
I am the leader of this enterprise...Giovanni!
Fwahahahaha!
How dare you?! You will pay for your insolence!
Your Pokémon exist for Team GO Rocket’s use.
I commend you for standing up to me, Trainer. I trust you’ll make this worth my time.
You are foolish to confront me, but I’m impressed by your confidence. Let’s battle.
My goal is beyond your comprehension.
If you insist on confronting me, you will pay the price!
You found a Super Rocket Radar!
The Super Rocket Radar is a stronger radar that can find headquarters where the Team GO Rocket Boss might be!
What an amusing Trainer.
As expected, Team GO Rocket cannot be stopped.
You cannot stop my master plan.
Do not try to interfere again.
You failed as soon as you challenged me, Trainer.
Global Challenge Arena
Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%. As you know, I do a lot of research. There are just so many Pokémon to learn about and document!
Recently, I’ve been investigating Ralts, the Feeling Pokémon, to learn more about how this Pokémon senses people’s emotions by using the horns on its head.
It’s an amazing ability, don’t you think?
I thought studying this Pokémon’s unique sensing powers could help me identify the strange feeling that’s been stirring inside me these past few weeks.
I’ve realized, though, that this isn’t any ordinary emotion—it’s a type of energy!
This mysterious energy is filling me with hope and determination. I feel like I could take on any challenge and be victorious!
I would appreciate your assistance in collecting more information on this strange and fascinating phenomenon.
Thanks for completing the research we needed to get started, %PLAYERNAME%.
While you were catching Pokémon and visiting PokéStops, I started digging through my research and found references to a phenomenon that seems to have a lot in common with what I’ve been experiencing.
The reports refer to a Mythical Pokémon that shares the infinite energy it creates with others to guarantee victory.
The reports also state that this Pokémon is Psychic- and Fire-type. What an amazing combination!
To get closer to confirming the source of the energy, let’s focus our efforts on catching Pokémon that share those same types.
Wonderful work, %PLAYERNAME%.
Thanks to your efforts researching Psychic- and Fire-type Pokémon, we’re well on our way to confirming the source of this mysterious energy.
There’s many a mystery surrounding our path forward, so I’ll keep poring over our research notes. In the meantime, I’d like you to work on becoming better friends with your Pokémon.
As a Trainer, strengthening the bond between you and your Pokémon is an important task that requires a specific set of skills.
To further develop those skills, why don’t you try spending time with your buddy?
Successful partnerships take work and dedication, and talented Trainers build lifelong friendships with their Pokémon.
That being said, be sure to spend time with your buddy every day!
You have a wonderful bond with your buddy, Trainer! It’s been a treat watching that friendship bloom. Now, though, it’s time to focus our efforts on the matter at hand!
After further examination of the research you completed, I’m convinced that the Pokémon we’re looking for is Victini, the Victory Pokémon.
Not only would this be consistent with the references to a Psychic- and Fire-type Pokémon, but it would also explain the mysterious surge of energy I’ve been experiencing.
It’s time for you to befriend Victini. Since this Pokémon represents victory, I think winning a few battles might inspire it to come forward!
I’ve been hearing reports that Team GO Rocket is causing trouble. Battling these troublemakers just might show this Pokémon you’re worthy of attention!
Let’s see whether some victory will attract the Victory Pokémon!
Absolutely astounding, %PLAYERNAME%! I knew you’d be able to display your powerful bonds and battle prowess to impress the Mythical Pokémon Victini.
It shares the infinite energy it creates when its body overflows with power, so I’m absolutely certain now that the energy I was feeling was coming directly from Victini!
Be sure to use this power wisely, %PLAYERNAME%, as you and Victini take on new challenges. But for now, your hard work calls for a celebration!
Why don’t you take a few snapshots with Victini and share your success with fellow Trainers by sending them some Gifts?
Once again, you have helped me uncover a huge discovery. I cannot thank you enough for your time and dedication.
The world of Pokémon is filled with endless discoveries, and it isn’t every day we come across a Mythical Pokémon!
I hope that you will take the lessons we learned together through this investigation and apply them to your training.
I’m proud of you, %PLAYERNAME%, and hope you continue to strive to be your very best. Until next time, let’s GO!

Welcome to Pokémon GO Fest 2020, %PLAYERNAME%! GO Fest this year is a little bit different from previous years, but it’ll be just as fun—and challenging!
I’ve noticed an amazing phenomenon—it seems as though different Pokémon are appearing in the area on what seems an hourly basis. I need your help collecting data on this situation.
We’ll have another fun-filled day tomorrow. For now, I’m going to start looking into this situation. Perhaps it’s related to a powerful Pokémon.
Now, %PLAYERNAME%, I’m sure you know what I’m going to say next.
Let’s GO!
I thought it would be fun to give you some tasks to help you research this phenomenon. I’ll make sure you get a reward for your hard work!
Don’t delay—since different Pokémon seem to be appearing each hour, you have limited time to complete these tasks! You can see Trainers’ progress by checking the Global Challenge Arena.
To help with your research, be sure to use Incense to attract Pokémon.
Remember, you can now activate several Incense at once and have them attract Pokémon to you for hours! Incense smells amazing, doesn’t it?
It brings a smile to my face knowing that millions of Trainers around the world are working together right now because of their shared love of Pokémon.
Furthermore, I’ve been sensing a great energy that has filled me with hope and determination. Have you been feeling it as well?
I wonder whether it’s connected to the strange happenings that kicked off our research this weekend.
I have a feeling today’s just the beginning of an exciting adventure!
GO Fest 2020: Welcome!
GO Fest 2020: Welcome! (1/1)
%PLAYERNAME%, by the look on your face, I’m sure you’ve grasped the situation.
Team GO Rocket confetti is raining down from the sky. Grunts are invading PokéStops all around the world. And...Team GO Rocket has taken over Pokémon GO Fest.
We thought we put a stop to them when we ended their take-over during our research leading up to GO Fest.
But that take-over appears to have been only part of a larger plan. We have yet to determine Team GO Rocket’s ultimate goal, though. Regardless of what it is, %PLAYERNAME%...you must prepare yourself.
I’m impressed by your energy and that of your fellow Trainers around the world! If we work together, I know victory is within our reach!
Great work, %PLAYERNAME%. Your Pokémon are ready for battle, and I bet your fellow Trainers are thankful for the supplies you’ve sent their way. We’ll need to work together to keep Team GO Rocket at bay and save Pokémon GO Fest!
Oh, what’s this? Looks like the snapshots you took feature some unwelcome guests! It’s amazing that Team GO Rocket can organize these massive take-overs, but its members do seem a little silly.
Or maybe these photobombs are actually all a part of their scheme? Anyway, why don’t you put all your training to use? In the meantime, I’ll do some more investigating with the team leaders.
Thanks to your hard work, you’ve caught a Golem!
The team leaders and I have been scoping out the Team GO Rocket balloons and have discovered that the Team GO Rocket Leaders are using Flying-type Pokémon.
Sources told me that Team GO Rocket might’ve captured some Legendary Pokémon and turned them into Shadow Pokémon, too!
If I recall correctly, the team leaders saw one of these balloons at GO Fest last year—and another during the Team GO Rocket take-over a few weeks ago.
I wouldn’t have imagined that Team GO Rocket would spend resources on such an...interesting means of transportation. However, it’s clear that the boss has put a lot of effort into providing his Grunts with balloons.
Your Golem might be a helpful addition to your battle party, since Flying types are weak to Rock-type attacks! %PLAYERNAME%, it’s time to rock Team GO Rocket’s world and save those Legendary Shadow Pokémon!
Great job defeating Sierra, Cliff, and Arlo. Now all that’s left is their boss, Giovanni. %PLAYERNAME%, are you ready?
Spark, Blanche, and Candela can handle the Team GO Rocket Leaders while you prepare to face the boss. It’s interesting that the Team GO Rocket Leaders are commanding these Legendary Shadow Pokémon, which are usually reserved for the boss himself.
Perhaps we’ll learn what this means as we uncover Team GO Rocket’s devious plans and discover what Pokémon Giovanni now has under his control.
On the bright side, I received an encouraging message from the team leaders about a mysterious phenomenon. Remember that powerful energy I detected yesterday?
The team leaders reported that Trainers worldwide suddenly felt a similar energy that filled them with hope and determination. Through my research, I found references to that very same energy.
They document a Mythical Pokémon that shares its infinite energy with others and guarantees a winning battle. I have a feeling that’s why Team GO Rocket is here.
Perhaps Team GO Rocket hopes to further its dastardly plans by using this powerful Pokémon?
I hear Giovanni often begins his battles with his Buddy Pokémon, Persian, which is weak to Fighting-type attacks. The Machamp you caught earlier might help you here.
Good luck, %PLAYERNAME%. The fate of Pokémon GO Fest is in your hands.
%PLAYERNAME%, you did it! You defeated Giovanni and sent him packing! Who would’ve thought that he could turn even Mewtwo into a Shadow Pokémon? That alone is a mystery we need to investigate.
It was a tough battle, and the fact that you defeated Mewtwo proves what an amazing Trainer you are.
Spark, Blanche, and Candela were victorious against the Team GO Rocket Leaders and drove them away, too.
Thanks to everyone’s efforts, we’ve saved Pokémon GO Fest! It’s time to celebrate!
Turns out, Team GO Rocket was after Victini, the Victory Pokémon! Some say this Pokémon brings victory to its Trainer, regardless of the contest.
I’m now sure that the energy we were all feeling was thanks to Victini. I’m in utter awe of your tenacity and determination. Pokémon GO Fest was saved because of your hard work. Thank you, %PLAYERNAME%.
Phew! Now, I think we should get back to having fun. There’s still time to enjoy the festivities!
While this year’s GO Fest was quite a bit different from previous ones, I’m overjoyed that Trainers all over the world could still come together to celebrate—and protect—our beloved Pokémon.
Even when we’re apart, we’re still united by our love of Pokémon. No matter what obstacles appear in your path, you can always count on your Pokémon and your fellow Trainers.
I know we’ll all meet again under the same sky someday, so until then...let’s GO!

Take a snapshot of Victini
We’ve taken over your celebration, and you still insist on challenging me? Get ready to face the harsh reality.
Your festival is in the hands of Team GO Rocket now. You cannot defeat us.
I’ll defeat you quickly so I can return to the take-over festivities.
I was supposed to win! Everything went perfectly for our take-over!
This take-over was supposed to be my biggest event of the year. How dare you humiliate me like this!
This confetti now just reminds me of my failure. This won’t be the last you see of me...
Today, this event. Tomorrow, the world!
Now that we’ve taken over your little celebration, I bet Candela is worried. Good.
Seeing this confetti rain down and all my hard work pay off... It reignites my passion to defeat you!
Look at me—I want to take a picture of this moment so I can revel in your disappointment later.
If only Candela could see me now. We’ve taken over your celebration, and now I’ve defeated you!
Isn’t this confetti beautiful?
I bet the boss is so proud of us for taking over this event! Don’t take this from us—I need this.
We’ve already taken over this event—now it’s time for the muscle to take you down!
Let’s finish this quick so I can join the other leaders and celebrate the take-over!
NO! We can’t lose our Team GO Rocket festival—we’ve come so far!
What just happened? Are we going to lose the event?
I can’t believe I failed the team.
Enjoying your little festival? Well, it’s a Team GO Rocket festival now!
Hahaha! I’m in a good mood today. This event is ours!
Team GO Rocket has come so far. We’ve finally taken over your big celebration!
Hahaha, what a great battle! Happy Team GO Rocket festival! Time to celebrate with my Grunts!
First we take over this big event, and now I win a battle? Best day ever!
Winning a battle is a great feeling. It’s even better after a take-over!
I do not think you are prepared for the level of failure you are about to experience!
You should be afraid to battle me, especially since you are already too late to stop my take-over!
You will regret trying to put a dent in my perfectly executed take-over. Your Pokémon will be mine!
This is not the end. I will have my revenge.
This festival will be mine one day. You will see—this is not over.
You have only delayed the inevitable. I will win.
I’m surprised you’ve been this successful, considering the foolish guidance your pathetic professor has given you.
I’m impressed that you got by my leaders, Trainer, but nothing will prepare you for my Shadow Pokémon!
At first, I was impressed by your dedication, but now you’ve become a nuisance. This festival is mine.
I hope you now understand how foolish challenging me was. You will never stop Team GO Rocket.
My incredible plan is going swimmingly. Move aside—this event is mine.
As expected. Run back to your professor—you still have much training to do.
Sure glad I got over that fear of heights... Oh, wait... What?
I’ve always wanted to see this event from the air! What a view!
Where do you think the boss got all these balloons?
Talk about getting the high ground! Eh? Eh?
I know I talked about moving up in the organization...but I didn’t think that would mean flying in a balloon...
Do you think there are any of those Pikachu visors left? I’d like to get one as a souvenir of the take-over.
Caw, caw... Worst event ever...
Get in a balloon, they said. It’ll be fun, they said. This is the worst event ever...
This confetti just makes me sad now. Worst event ever.
Caw, CAW! We’ve already taken the skies, and now we’ve taken your precious event, too!
Team GO Rocket’s balloon squad, reporting for duty! We’ve taken over this festival!
Wow! The confetti looks great from up here!
Today, this celebration. Tomorrow, the world!
I know you hate to see us take over your festival but love to watch us fly away.
Can’t wait to fly around in my handy-dandy hot-air balloon and defeat other event attendees!
I didn’t even need to be here for this take-over. Just to make it worth my time, let’s battle.
I know I’ll be disappointed in your battling, so let’s just get this over with.
Might as well pass the time with a battle, considering your little event is ruined.
This must be a mistake. Failure isn’t an option.
You must have some kind of special power on your side that made you win. That’s the only explanation...
I can’t believe I lost to such an unworthy opponent! You’ll pay for disrupting our plans!
It’s almost silly that I’m here, considering we already took over this event.
Aww, you think the confetti is for you... Sorry, darling, it’s for our flawless victory.
You’ve already had your fun. This year, your little festival is ours!
Oh surprise, surprise—I won. I wouldn’t expect anything less.
See? Wasn’t that a silly waste of time? This celebration is ours!
I’m sorry, darling—you lost. I’m afraid I can’t relate. I don’t know what losing feels like.

Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! Check this out—I’ve been practicing.
Hello there! Welcome to the world of Pokémon GO! My name is Willow. People call me the Pokémon Prof!
This world is inhabited by creatures called Pokémon! Some people keep Pokémon as companions. Others have them do battle. Myself? I study Pokémon as a profession.
Did that remind you of anyone? For many years, Trainers from Kanto have heard similar remarks before embarking on their journeys through the region.
I have the honor of making them today because you’re about to head out on your own Kanto-inspired journey.
But we can’t have you leaving unprepared! I’ve put together some supplies I think you’ll find useful.
Berries, Potions, and Poké Balls. Looks like you’re all set!
As you begin today’s adventure, try to imagine you’re stepping straight into the tall grass of Kanto.
I have a feeling you’ll meet a Pokémon that will make a wonderful partner on your journey. Be sure to take some snapshots of the Pokémon you encounter along the way!
On adventures, I find it’s helpful to document not only your findings but also your memories. And I’m sure you’ll make plenty of both!
Now, in the words of a wise professor: Your very own Pokémon legend is about to unfold! A world of dreams and adventures with Pokémon awaits! Let's GO!
How’s your journey going, %PLAYERNAME%? Oh! Found a partner Pokémon to join you, eh? Wonderful work.
In the Kanto region, Trainers are often presented with three options when it comes to their first partner Pokémon.
The first is Bulbasaur, the Seed Pokémon, #001 in the Pokédex. This Grass-type Pokémon has a plant seed on its back right from the day it’s born.
Another option is Charmander, the Lizard Pokémon. It’s a Fire-type Pokémon, and it has a flame on its tail that shows the strength of its life force.
Last—but certainly not least—is Squirtle, the Tiny Turtle Pokémon. After birth, this Water-type Pokémon's back swells and hardens into a shell.
Each of these Pokémon have their strengths and weaknesses, so be sure to study up! For now, though, it’s time to get back to your adventure.
I’d like you to spend some time with your buddy. The relationship between a Trainer and their Pokémon is of utmost importance!
How about going on a walk together? I always enjoy exploring with my buddy!
Wonderful work, Trainer! Glad to see you’re growing closer to your buddy. Keep it up, and you’ll become even closer in no time.
When it comes to being a Trainer, people often talk about catching techniques or battle strategies, but I find that friendship is just as essential.
Not only are the relationships you build with your Pokémon incredibly important, but so are the friendships you build with other Trainers.
Your personal journeys and goals may vary, but at the end of the day, you’re all Trainers! You should do your best to connect with the other Trainers you meet on your travels.
In that spirit, how about sending your friends some Gifts to brighten their day? I’m sure they’d love to hear from you!
Welcome back, Trainer! Hope you enjoyed connecting with other Trainers. I see you were even able to trade a few Pokémon!
Trading is a fabulous way to acquire Pokémon you might not have otherwise encountered.
And not only do you get a new entry in your Pokédex, but you also get a new friend!
You’ve already made great progress on your journey. I think it’s time to show off the skills you’ve learned along the way!
How about showcasing your throwing expertise by catching some Pokémon? Don’t forget to make use of your Berries, too.
I’m especially fond of Pinap Berries. They help you earn extra Candy for the Pokémon you’re catching—and they’re tasty to boot!
I’m sure I had a stash of Pinap Berries here somewhere... Oh! Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! Guess my snack will have to wait.
I’ve been checking up on your progress, and I have to say, I’m very impressed! It seems there’s no challenge you can’t overcome.
As I’m sure you know, a well-rounded Trainer needs to have a great team of Pokémon to battle against other Trainers or even challenge Pokémon in raids.
I think this is a great time to power up some of your Pokémon and bolster your team.
While you focus on that, I’ll be looking into an interesting rumor I caught wind of.
There have been reports of encounters with a Pokémon that’s able to transform into another Pokémon entirely. Fascinating stuff!
I’ll be sure to share whatever I find when you return.
Glad you’re back, Trainer. After looking into those reports, it certainly sounds like the work of Ditto, the Transform Pokémon.
Ditto rearranges its cell structure to transform itself into other shapes. What an incredible Pokémon!
However, there seems to be something more to this situation.
Could you help me with some research so we can find out what exactly is going on?
I’ll continue my work here to see if I can uncover some more information that might help us.
%PLAYERNAME%! Is it true?! You encountered a Shiny Ditto?! I’m stunned!
You’ve had quite the journey, haven’t you? It’s been a joy to follow your progress, as always.
Believe it or not, though, there’s still another mystery that needs solving.
You see, after looking over the research you’ve conducted, I think we might be on the trail of the New Species Pokémon, Mew.
We've documented Mew in the past, but something’s different this time—though I can’t yet say what that is.
Whatever the case, I think it’s safe to say this is going to be a memorable adventure!
In the meantime, keep an eye out for another research assignment. I have a feeling this is going to be an especially challenging endeavor, but I’m sure you’re up to it!
For now, though, I think congratulations are in order. You did a tremendous job on today’s Kanto-themed journey!
I hope you were able to make some special memories with your Pokémon and fellow Trainers. Thanks again for all your help and hard work!
Now, let’s GO!

Curious... Upon their defeat, your opponent seems to have abandoned the Pokémon they battled with. It has a strange and ominous aura.
I have a hypothesis about what kind of Pokémon it is... Could you catch it so we can examine it more closely?
Your opponent fled...and left their Pokémon behind. That really burns me up. There seems to be an ominous aura around the poor Pokémon, too.
Could you try to catch it and see what’s so different about this Pokémon?
They’ve carelessly abandoned the Pokémon they lost with! It has an ominous aura and is somewhat different from regular Pokémon. Try to catch it so we can save it!
They’ve carelessly abandoned the Pokémon they lost with! It has an ominous aura and is somewhat different from regular Pokémon. Try to catch it so we can save it!
Whoa, looks like they couldn’t handle a little battle! They even left behind their Pokémon. Why would they do that?
It has a really odd aura around it... Let’s help it! Can you catch it so we can take a closer look?
Professor Willow’s ingenuity knows no bounds.
Once equipped, the Super Rocket Radar begins receiving encrypted signals. Could the signals be coming from Team GO Rocket Headquarters?
Best prepare for any obstacles that might appear. Team GO Rocket’s numbers are staggering.
Their leader is strong but no match for Team Mystic. Let’s GO.
Just look at this radar! You can just tell it’s more powerful than the others!
My bet? It’s receiving signals from Team GO Rocket Headquarters.
I’m getting fired up, but I know there have to be more hurdles before facing the Team GO Rocket Boss.
I’ve heard their boss is fierce... But you’re on Team Valor, so I know you can handle it.
This radar looks upgraded and WAY more powerful than others we’ve made!
Think it’ll take us to whoever’s leading Team GO Rocket?
I know it can’t be that easy. I bet Team GO Rocket has plenty more Grunts blocking our way.
I’m ready if you are! Equip that radar, and let’s show ’em what Team Instinct is made of!
Professor Willow’s research and the components you’ve discovered have come together to produce a Rocket Radar.
We’ve reverse engineered their technology and can now receive their hideouts’ signals.
Equip the radar to activate it. It’s time to investigate—and be prepared for whatever comes our way.
Great work! Fighting all those Grunts was worth the effort!
A Rocket Radar! Professor Willow said once it’s equipped, you can intercept signals from Team GO Rocket.
Finally, we can find those hideouts! Let’s GO take out these punks!
Whoa! I knew the professor was right when he said these things could be used for something aside from hacking PokéStops!
Is that a radar? Awesome! There’s no way they can hide from us with this!
Let’s try it out and track down some hideouts!
Trainer, some shadowy figures have been seen at PokéStops. Approach with caution, and be ready for battle.
I’ve been hearing reports of some mysterious characters near PokéStops. You should take charge and go investigate. Be careful, and make sure you’re prepared for a battle!
Some mysterious characters have shown up at PokéStops! Watch out—it might turn into a battle!
Some mysterious characters have shown up at PokéStops! Watch out—it might turn into a battle!
I overheard that some shady characters have been showing up at PokéStops. I think you need to check it out, but be careful—I have a feeling you might end up in a battle!
That Grunt dropped some sort of device. It looks like this is what they were using to hack the PokéStops.
Ah, I recognize this from Willow’s lab. I wonder...
Yes. I believe this can help with his prototype. Please head out and collect more.
That Grunt dropped something while they were running scared! What are they using these for?
I bet this is what Team GO Rocket is using to hack the PokéStops...
We have to find more. Time to battle some Grunts!
Hey... That Grunt dropped something. What does this thing do?
This looks like a piece of something right out of Willow’s lab!
I bet this will help with that prototype he’s developing... Let’s see if we can find more.
Your Pokémon storage is full, so you will not be able to encounter a Shadow Pokémon. To make room, you can transfer Pokémon to Professor Willow or upgrade your Pokémon storage in the shop.
If my analysis is correct, we can help this Pokémon through a process known as purification. This will enable it to harness its strength. Shall we give it a try?
I think we can help this Pokémon. Purification is a process that makes certain Pokémon stronger by tapping into their inner power. Let’s give it a try.
It looks like we can help this Pokémon become stronger through a process called purification. Let’s try it!

Ah, %PLAYERNAME%! Glad to have you aboard this expedition. Say, have you ever heard this particular tune?
Da da da doo, da dee da dum... That’s what I hear in my head when I think of a certain sailor and his Wingull that I met while traveling through the Hoenn region in my younger years.
I believe the tune was originally a sea shanty. Sailors would sing songs like this together on their seafaring adventures to keep morale high and help find a rhythm during certain tasks.
I’m no sailor, but I do find myself feeling luckier after humming it! Haha!
Anyway, we’re here to look into the strange situation we uncovered during your Kanto-themed journey.
I’m talking, of course, about reports of encounters with Mew, the New Species Pokémon. There have been several sightings of a Shiny one recently, which is tremendously exciting!
That means our goal on this expedition is to find not only one of the most elusive Pokémon to ever exist, but a Shiny one at that!
You’ve experienced a lot on your journeys thus far, %PLAYERNAME%. But perhaps the most wonderful thing about Pokémon is that there’s always something new to discover.
I hope you’re excited for what’s to come, because I have a feeling it’s going to be a real test of your skills as a Trainer!
Let’s GO!
Wow, %PLAYERNAME%—great work! Your knowledge of the Kanto region is beginning to rival even my own!
Our next task is to learn more about Pokémon DNA.
I know that sounds pretty heavy on the science, but don’t worry—I’ll take care of that part. All I need you to do is get out there and catch lots of different types of Pokémon!
Mew’s DNA is said to contain the genetic codes of all Pokémon, so to better understand Mew, we should try to understand as much as we can about the genetics of other Pokémon.
Incredible work, %PLAYERNAME%! Seeing you learn so much about different Pokémon reminded me of how vast the world of Pokémon truly is.
Knowledge is funny in that the more we gain, the more realize how much we still lack. Some might find that frustrating, but for me it’s inspiring!
You know, there’s a part in that sea shanty I mentioned before that seems applicable here.
I don’t remember the exact words, but the gist is that we should travel across the land, searching far and wide to learn about all the amazing Pokémon there are in the world.
Words to live by, I say! Let’s get out there and track down that Shiny Mew, Trainer!
%PLAYERNAME%, you... You did it! You actually found and caught a Shiny Mew!
Has it even sunk in yet? This is a monumental achievement, Trainer. Take a moment to congratulate yourself!
Hm? It’s my achievement as well? Haha! No, no, I just hummed you a shanty and guided you like any Pokémon Professor worth their sea salt would.
But thanks are certainly in order for the Pokémon you’ve befriended on your journey. They played a big part in your research, after all!
The ones you’ve caught, the ones you’ve battled with, and the ones that traveled with you as your buddy—each Pokémon played a critical part in helping you achieve this goal.
As Trainers, we owe an eternal debt to our Pokémon. After all, we can’t very well be Trainers without them!
A Trainer’s journey is meant to be filled with amazing memories, ambitious dreams, and unexpected adventures. I think this particular journey checked all those boxes pretty handily!
I’m sure it won’t be the last to do so, either. Now, until next time...let’s GO!

Hello there!I am Professor Willow.
Did you know that this world is inhabited by creatures known as Pokémon?
Pokémon can be found in every corner of the earth.
Some run across the plains, others fly through the skies, some live in the mountains, or in the forests, or near water…
I have spent my whole life studying them and their geography.
Will you help me with my research?
That’s great!
You’ll need to find and collect Pokémon from everywhere.

Please enter a complete title.
A PokéStop is an in-game location that encourages Trainers to go outside, discover new places, and connect with people in the community. PokéStops usually contain some kind of civic, educational, or artistic value, whether it’s a cool piece of art or a hidden gem that only the locals know.
Submit a name, description, and photo of the location you’ve selected. Your nominated PokéStop will then be reviewed by other Niantic players, so please be thorough and accurate!
PokéStops should have educational and cultural value, and their locations should be safe and accessible to pedestrians. Avoid nominating locations at private residences, locations that are seasonal or nonpermanent, or locations that could interfere with emergency service vehicles. 
Write a concise title and a detailed description of your nominated PokéStop. The title should be an official name when possible. The description should include the history, cultural significance, or educational value of your location. Write the title and description yourself and please do not copy from other resources.

Pokémon Day
--
Bulbasaur can be seen napping in bright sunlight. There is a seed on its back. By soaking up the sun's rays, the seed grows progressively larger.
There is a bud on this Pokémon's back. To support its weight, Ivysaur's legs and trunk grow thick and strong. If it starts spending more time lying in the sunlight, it's a sign that the bud will bloom into a large flower soon.
There is a large flower on Venusaur's back. The flower is said to take on vivid colors if it gets plenty of nutrition and sunlight. The flower's aroma soothes the emotions of people.
The flame that burns at the tip of its tail is an indication of its emotions. The flame wavers when Charmander is enjoying itself. If the Pokémon becomes enraged, the flame burns fiercely.
Charmeleon mercilessly destroys its foes using its sharp claws. If it encounters a strong foe, it turns aggressive. In this excited state, the flame at the tip of its tail flares with a bluish white color.
Charizard flies around the sky in search of powerful opponents. It breathes fire of such great heat that it melts anything. However, it never turns its fiery breath on any opponent weaker than itself.
Squirtle's shell is not merely used for protection. The shell's rounded shape and the grooves on its surface help minimize resistance in water, enabling this Pokémon to swim at high speeds.
Its tail is large and covered with a rich, thick fur. The tail becomes increasingly deeper in color as Wartortle ages. The scratches on its shell are evidence of this Pokémon's toughness as a battler.
Blastoise has water spouts that protrude from its shell. The water spouts are very accurate. They can shoot bullets of water with enough accuracy to strike empty cans from a distance of over 160 feet.
Caterpie has a voracious appetite. It can devour leaves bigger than its body right before your eyes. From its antenna, this Pokémon releases a terrifically strong odor.
The shell covering this Pokémon's body is as hard as an iron slab. Metapod does not move very much. It stays still because it is preparing its soft innards for evolution inside the hard shell.
Butterfree has a superior ability to search for delicious honey from flowers. It can even search out, extract, and carry honey from flowers that are blooming over six miles from its nest.
Weedle has an extremely acute sense of smell. It is capable of distinguishing its favorite kinds of leaves from those it dislikes just by sniffing with its big red proboscis (nose).
Kakuna remains virtually immobile as it clings to a tree. However, on the inside, it is extremely busy as it prepares for its coming evolution. This is evident from how hot the shell becomes to the touch.
Beedrill is extremely territorial. No one should ever approach its nest—this is for their own safety. If angered, they will attack in a furious swarm.
Pidgey has an extremely sharp sense of direction. It is capable of unerringly returning home to its nest, however far it may be removed from its familiar surroundings.
Pidgeotto claims a large area as its own territory. This Pokémon flies around, patrolling its living space. If its territory is violated, it shows no mercy in thoroughly punishing the foe with its sharp claws.
This Pokémon has a dazzling plumage of beautifully glossy feathers. Many Trainers are captivated by the striking beauty of the feathers on its head, compelling them to choose Pidgeot as their Pokémon.
Rattata is cautious in the extreme. Even while it is asleep, it constantly listens by moving its ears around. It is not picky about where it lives—it will make its nest anywhere.
Night after night, they sneak into people's homes seeking food. A massive outbreak of them has become an issue of public concern.
Raticate's sturdy fangs grow steadily. To keep them ground down, it gnaws on rocks and logs. It may even chew on the walls of houses.
It commands a nest of Rattata. Different nests don't get along, whipping up severe fights over feeding grounds.
Spearow has a very loud cry that can be heard over half a mile away. If its high, keening cry is heard echoing all around, it is a sign that they are warning each other of danger.
Fearow is recognized by its long neck and elongated beak. They are conveniently shaped for catching prey in soil or water. It deftly moves its long and skinny beak to pluck prey.
Ekans curls itself up in a spiral while it rests. Assuming this position allows it to quickly respond to a threat from any direction with a glare from its upraised head.
This Pokémon is terrifically strong in order to constrict things with its body. It can even flatten steel oil drums. Once Arbok wraps its body around its foe, escaping its crushing embrace is impossible.
Whenever Pikachu comes across something new, it blasts it with a jolt of electricity. If you come across a blackened berry, it's evidence that this Pokémon mistook the intensity of its charge.
If the electrical sacs become excessively charged, Raichu plants its tail in the ground and discharges. Scorched patches of ground will be found near this Pokémon's nest.
When you rub its cheeks, a sweet fragrance comes wafting out. However, you'll also get a light shock!
Sandshrew's body is configured to absorb water without waste, enabling it to survive in an arid desert. This Pokémon curls up to protect itself from its enemies.
The skin on its back is as hard as steel. Predators go after its soft belly, so it clings to the ground desperately.
Sandslash's body is covered by tough spikes, which are hardened sections of its hide. Once a year, the old spikes fall out, to be replaced with new spikes that grow out from beneath the old ones.
A long, long time ago, it lived in the desert. With its sharp claws fully extended, it can climb right up an iceberg without slipping.
Nidoran♀ has barbs that secrete a powerful poison. They are thought to have developed as protection for this small-bodied Pokémon. When enraged, it releases a horrible toxin from its horn.
When Nidorina are with their friends or family, they keep their barbs tucked away to prevent hurting each other. This Pokémon appears to become nervous if separated from the others.
Nidoqueen's body is encased in extremely hard scales. It is adept at sending foes flying with harsh tackles. This Pokémon is at its strongest when it is defending its young.
Nidoran♂ has developed muscles for moving its ears. Thanks to them, the ears can be freely moved in any direction. Even the slightest sound does not escape this Pokémon's notice.
Nidorino has a horn that is harder than a diamond. If it senses a hostile presence, all the barbs on its back bristle up at once, and it challenges the foe with all its might.
Nidoking's thick tail packs enormously destructive power. With one swing, it can topple a metal transmission tower. Once this Pokémon goes on a rampage, there is no stopping it.
On every night of a full moon, groups of this Pokémon come out to play. When dawn arrives, the tired Clefairy return to their quiet mountain retreats and go to sleep nestled up against each other.
Clefable moves by skipping lightly as if it were flying using its wings. Its bouncy step lets it even walk on water. It is known to take strolls on lakes on quiet, moonlit nights.
At the time of its birth, Vulpix has one white tail. The tail separates into six if this Pokémon receives plenty of love from its Trainer. The six tails become magnificently curled.
They live together in a skulk, helping one another. Before eating their prey, they freeze it solid with their –58 degree Fahrenheit breath.
Ninetales casts a sinister light from its bright red eyes to gain total control over its foe's mind. This Pokémon is said to live for a thousand years.
Some said that deities visited mountains where Ninetales live, so in times long past, no one was allowed to go into those mountains.
Jigglypuff's vocal cords can freely adjust the wavelength of its voice. This Pokémon uses this ability to sing at precisely the right wavelength to make its foes most drowsy.
Wigglytuff has large, saucerlike eyes. The surfaces of its eyes are always covered with a thin layer of tears. If any dust gets in this Pokémon's eyes, it is quickly washed away.
Zubat remains quietly unmoving in a dark spot during the bright daylight hours. It does so because prolonged exposure to the sun causes its body to become slightly burned.
Golbat loves to drink the blood of living things. It is particularly active in the pitch black of night. This Pokémon flits around in the night skies, seeking fresh blood.
During the daytime, Oddish buries itself in soil to absorb nutrients from the ground using its entire body. The more fertile the soil, the glossier its leaves become.
Gloom releases a foul fragrance from the pistil of its flower. When faced with danger, the stench worsens. If this Pokémon is feeling calm and secure, it does not release its usual stinky aroma.
Vileplume's toxic pollen triggers atrocious allergy attacks. That's why it is advisable never to approach any attractive flowers in a jungle, however pretty they may be.
Paras has parasitic mushrooms growing on its back called tochukaso. They grow large by drawing nutrients from this Bug Pokémon host. They are highly valued as a medicine for extending life.
Parasect is known to infest large trees en masse and drain nutrients from the lower trunk and roots. When an infested tree dies, they move onto another tree all at once.
Venonat is said to have evolved with a coat of thin, stiff hair that covers its entire body for protection. It possesses large eyes that never fail to spot even minuscule prey.
Venomoth is nocturnal—it is a Pokémon that only becomes active at night. Its favorite prey are small insects that gather around streetlights, attracted by the light in the darkness.
Diglett are raised in most farms. The reason is simple—wherever this Pokémon burrows, the soil is left perfectly tilled for planting crops. This soil is made ideal for growing delicious vegetables.
The need to dig through volcanic rock in the ground has made them more powerful than the Diglett of other regions.
Dugtrio are actually triplets that emerged from one body. As a result, each triplet thinks exactly like the other two triplets. They work cooperatively to burrow endlessly.
Its shining gold whiskers are advanced sensors that can detect vibrations from sounds several miles away.
Meowth withdraws its sharp claws into its paws to slinkily sneak about without making any incriminating footsteps. For some reason, this Pokémon loves shiny coins that glitter with light.
A royal house that flourished in the distant past brought it here from another region. Meowth is both selfish and prideful.
Living with a savage, seafaring people has toughened this Pokémon's body so much that parts of it have turned to iron.
Persian has six bold whiskers that give it a look of toughness. The whiskers sense air movements to determine what is in the Pokémon's surrounding vicinity. It becomes docile if grabbed by the whiskers.
Its round face is a symbol of wealth. Persian that have bigger, plumper faces are considered more beautiful.
Psyduck uses a mysterious power. When it does so, this Pokémon generates brain waves that are supposedly only seen in sleepers. This discovery spurred controversy among scholars.
The webbed flippers on its forelegs and hind legs and the streamlined body of Golduck give it frightening speed. This Pokémon is definitely much faster than even the most athletic swimmer.
When Mankey starts shaking and its nasal breathing turns rough, it's a sure sign that it is becoming angry. However, because it goes into a towering rage almost instantly, it is impossible for anyone to flee its wrath.
When Primeape becomes furious, its blood circulation is boosted. In turn, its muscles are made even stronger. However, it also becomes much less intelligent at the same time.
Growlithe has a superb sense of smell. Once it smells anything, this Pokémon won't forget the scent, no matter what. It uses its advanced olfactory sense to determine the emotions of other living things.
Arcanine is known for its high speed. It is said to be capable of running over 6,200 miles in a single day and night. The fire that blazes wildly within this Pokémon's body is its source of power.
Poliwag has a very thin skin. It is possible to see the Pokémon's spiral innards right through the skin. Despite its thinness, however, the skin is also very flexible. Even sharp fangs bounce right off it.
The surface of Poliwhirl's body is always wet and slick with a slimy fluid. Because of this slippery covering, it can easily slip and slide out of the clutches of any enemy in battle.
Poliwrath's highly developed, brawny muscles never grow fatigued, however much it exercises. It is so tirelessly strong, this Pokémon can swim back and forth across the ocean without effort.
Abra sleeps for 18 hours a day. However, it can sense the presence of foes even while it is sleeping. In such a situation, this Pokémon immediately teleports to safety.
Kadabra emits a peculiar alpha wave if it develops a headache. Only those people with a particularly strong psyche can hope to become a Trainer of this Pokémon.
Alakazam's brain continually grows, making its head far too heavy to support with its neck. This Pokémon holds its head up using its psychokinetic power instead.
Machop's muscles are special—they never get sore no matter how much they are used in exercise. This Pokémon has sufficient power to hurl a hundred adult humans.
Machoke's thoroughly toned muscles possess the hardness of steel. This Pokémon has so much strength, it can easily hold aloft a sumo wrestler on just one finger.
Machamp has the power to hurl anything aside. However, trying to do any work requiring care and dexterity causes its arms to get tangled. This Pokémon tends to leap into action before it thinks.
Bellsprout's thin and flexible body lets it bend and sway to avoid any attack, however strong it may be. From its mouth, this Pokémon spits a corrosive fluid that melts even iron.
Weepinbell has a large hook on its rear end. At night, the Pokémon hooks on to a tree branch and goes to sleep. If it moves around in its sleep, it may wake up to find itself on the ground.
Victreebel has a long vine that extends from its head. This vine is waved and flicked about as if it were an animal to attract prey. When an unsuspecting prey draws near, this Pokémon swallows it whole.
Tentacool's body is largely composed of water. If it is removed from the sea, it dries up like parchment. If this Pokémon happens to become dehydrated, put it back into the sea.
Tentacruel has large red orbs on its head. The orbs glow before lashing the vicinity with a harsh ultrasonic blast. This Pokémon's outburst creates rough waves around it.
The longer a Geodude lives, the more its edges are chipped and worn away, making it more rounded in appearance. However, this Pokémon's heart will remain hard, craggy, and rough always.
Geodude compete against each other with headbutts. The iron sand on their heads will stick to whichever one has stronger magnetism.
Graveler grows by feeding on rocks. Apparently, it prefers to eat rocks that are covered in moss. This Pokémon eats its way through a ton of rocks on a daily basis.
Graveler's entire body is tinged with electricity due to the stones it likes to eat. It's very quick-tempered.
Golem live up on mountains. If there is a large earthquake, these Pokémon will come rolling down off the mountains en masse to the foothills below.
It shoots large rocks that are charged with electricity. Tremendous electric shocks are flung out across the whole area of impact.
Ponyta is very weak at birth. It can barely stand up. This Pokémon becomes stronger by stumbling and falling to keep up with its parent.
Its small horn hides a healing power. With a few rubs from this Pokémon’s horn, any slight wound you have will be healed.
Rapidash usually can be seen casually cantering in the fields and plains. However, when this Pokémon turns serious, its fiery manes flare and blaze as it gallops its way up to 150 mph.
Little can stand up to its psycho cut. Unleashed from this Pokémon’s horn, the move will punch a hole right through a thick metal sheet.
Slowpoke uses its tail to catch prey by dipping it in water at the side of a river. However, this Pokémon often forgets what it's doing and often spends entire days just loafing at water's edge.

They shoot paralyzing liquid from their head bumps. They use vibration to hurt their opponents.
When it encounters a foe bigger than itself, it wants to throw it. It changes belts as it gets stronger.
Tying their belts gets them pumped and makes their punches more destructive. Disturbing their training angers them.
Since this Pokémon makes its own clothes out of leaves, it is a popular mascot for fashion designers.
It protects itself from the cold by wrapping up in leaves. It stays on the move, eating leaves in forests.
It keeps its eggs warm with heat from fermenting leaves. It also uses leaves to make warm wrappings for Sewaddle.
Its bite injects a potent poison, enough to paralyze large bird Pokémon that try to prey on it.
It is usually motionless, but when attacked, it rotates at high speed and then crashes into its opponent.
With quick movements, it chases down its foes, attacking relentlessly with its horns until it prevails.

They migrate according to the seasons, so some people call Sawsbuck the harbingers of spring.

It arrives near the moment of death and steals spirit from the body.
The spirits burned up in its ominous flame lose their way and wander this world forever.
They mark their territory by leaving gashes in trees with their tusks. If a tusk breaks, a new one grows in quickly.
A broken tusk will not grow back, so it diligently sharpens its tusks on river rocks after the end of a battle.
Their sturdy tusks will stay sharp even if used to cut steel beams. These Pokémon are covered in hard armor.
Their snot is a barometer of health. When healthy, their snot is sticky and the power of their ice moves increases.
It freezes its breath to create fangs and claws of ice to fight with. Cold northern areas are its habitat.
They are composed of ice crystals. They capture prey with chains of ice, freezing the prey at -148 degrees Fahrenheit.
It evolves when bathed in an electric-like energy along with Karrablast. The reason is still unknown.
When its body dries out, it weakens. So, to prevent dehydration, it wraps itself in many layers of thin membrane.
It conceals itself in the mud of the seashore. Then it waits. When prey touch it, it delivers a jolt of electricity.
Living in mud with a high iron content has given it a strong steel body.
They seclude themselves in the mountains and devote themselves to training. The form of their kicks and chops differs from pack to pack.
When Mienshao lets out a bizarre wail, you're in danger. A flurry of kicks and chops too fast to see is about to be unleashed!
It infiltrates tunnels that Pokémon like Diglett and Dugtrio have dug and quietly waits for prey to pass through.
Although ancient people apparently built it by working with clay, the source of its energy is unclear.
When the seal on its chest is removed, it rages indiscriminately, turning the whole town around it into a mountain of rubble.

Their fluffy fur absorbs damage, even if they strike foes with a fierce headbutt.
Known as a natural-born warrior, soon after its hatching, it will challenge its parent to a fight in order to gain their acceptance.
Known as “the hero of the skies," this Pokémon is so proud and so brave that it will never retreat, even when it's injured.
Its healthy appetite leads to visible growth spurts. It often has to replace the bones it wears as its size increases.
It's always searching for food for Vullaby. When it finds a weak Pokémon, Mandibuzz swoops it right off to its nest.
It draws in air through its tail, transforms it into fire, and uses it like a tongue. It melts Durant and eats them.
They attack in groups, covering themselves in steel armor to protect themselves from Heatmor.
Lacking sight, it's unaware of its surroundings, so it bumps into things and eats anything that moves.
After it has eaten up all the food in its territory, it moves to another area. Its two heads do not get along.
It responds to movement by attacking. This scary, three-headed Pokémon devours everything in its path!
It protects itself with flame. Long years ago, people believed Larvesta had a nest on the sun.
According to legends, it was hatched from a flaming cocoon to save people and Pokémon that were suffering from the cold.
It has a body and heart of steel. It worked with its allies to punish people when they hurt Pokémon.
Spoken of in legend, this Pokémon used its phenomenal power to destroy a castle in its effort to protect Pokémon.
Legends say this Pokémon confounded opponents with its swift movements.
Tornadus expels massive energy from its tail, causing severe storms. Its power is great enough to blow houses away.
As it flies around, it shoots lightning all over the place and causes forest fires. It is therefore disliked.
When Reshiram's tail flares, the heat energy moves the atmosphere and changes the world's weather.
Concealing itself in lightning clouds, it flies throughout the Unova region. It creates electricity in its tail.
From the forces of lightning and wind, it creates energy to give nutrients to the soil and make the land abundant.
It generates a powerful, freezing energy inside itself, but its body became frozen when the energy leaked out.
When it is resolute, its body fills with power and it becomes swifter. Its jumps are then too fast to follow.
Its melodies are sung with a special vocalization method that can control the feelings of those who hear it.
This Pokémon existed 300 million years ago. Team Plasma altered it and attached a cannon to its back.
The quills on its head are usually soft. When it flexes them, the points become so hard and sharp that they can pierce rock.
It relies on its sturdy shell to deflect predators' attacks. It counterattacks with its sharp quills.
Its Tackle is forceful enough to flip a 50-ton tank. It shields its allies from danger with its own body.
Eating a twig fills it with energy, and its roomy ears give vent to air hotter than 390 degrees Fahrenheit.
It has a twig stuck in its tail. With friction from its tail fur, it sets the twig on fire and launches into battle.
It gazes into the flame at the tip of its branch to achieve a focused state, which allows it to see into the future.
It secretes flexible bubbles from its chest and back. The bubbles reduce the damage it would otherwise take when attacked.
It can throw bubble-covered pebbles with precise control, hitting empty cans up to a hundred feet away.
It creates throwing stars out of compressed water. When it spins them and throws them at high speed, these stars can split metal in two.
They use their large ears to dig burrows. They will dig the whole night through.
With their powerful ears, they can heft boulders of a ton or more with ease. They can be a big help at construction sites.
These friendly Pokémon send signals to one another with beautiful chirps and tail-feather movements.
From its beak, it expels embers that set the tall grass on fire. Then it pounces on the bewildered prey that pop out of the grass.
In the fever of an exciting battle, it showers embers from the gaps between its feathers and takes to the air.
When under attack from bird Pokémon, it spews a poisonous black powder that causes paralysis on contact.
It lives hidden within thicket shadows. When predators attack, it quickly bristles the fur covering its body in an effort to threaten them.
Vivillon with many different patterns are found all over the world. These patterns are affected by the climate of their habitat.
The stronger the opponent it faces, the more heat surges from its mane and the more power flows through its body.
The male with the largest mane of fire is the leader of the pride.
It draws out and controls the hidden power of flowers. The flower Flabébé holds is most likely part of its body.
It flutters around fields of flowers and cares for flowers that are starting to wilt. It draws out the hidden power of flowers to battle.
It claims exquisite flower gardens as its territory, and it obtains power from basking in the energy emitted by flowering plants.
Thought to be one of the first Pokémon to live in harmony with humans, it has a placid disposition.
It can tell how its Trainer is feeling by subtle shifts in the grip on its horns. This empathic sense lets them run as if one being.
It does its best to be taken seriously by its enemies, but its glare is not sufficiently intimidating. Chewing on a leaf is its trademark.
Although it possesses a violent temperament, it won't put up with bullying. It uses the leaf in its mouth to sense the movements of its enemies.
Trimming its fluffy fur not only makes it more elegant but also increases the swiftness of its movements.
The organ that emits its intense psychic power is sheltered by its ears to keep power from leaking out.
When in danger, it raises its ears and releases enough psychic power to grind a 10-ton truck into dust.
Apparently this Pokémon is born when a departed spirit inhabits a sword. It attaches itself to people and drinks their life force.
When Honedge evolves, it divides into two swords, which cooperate via telepathy to coordinate attacks and slash their enemies to ribbons.
Generations of kings were attended by these Pokémon, which used their spectral power to manipulate and control people and Pokémon.
It emits a scent that enraptures those who smell it. This fragrance changes depending on what it has eaten.
It devises various scents, pleasant and unpleasant, and emits scents that its enemies dislike in order to gain an edge in battle.
To entangle its opponents in battle, it extrudes white threads as sweet and sticky as cotton candy.
It can distinguish the faintest of scents. It puts its sensitive sense of smell to use by helping pastry chefs in their work.
Opponents who stare at the flashing of the light-emitting spots on its body become dazed and lose their will to fight.
It wields the most compelling hypnotic powers of any Pokémon, and it forces others to do whatever it wants.
Two Binacle live together on one rock. When they fight, one of them will move to a different rock.
When they evolve, two Binacle multiply into seven. They fight with the power of seven Binacle.
Camouflaged as rotten kelp, they spray liquid poison on prey that approaches unawares and then finish it off.
Their poison is strong enough to eat through the hull of a tanker, and they spit it indiscriminately at anything that enters their territory.
They knock down flying prey by firing compressed water from their massive claws like shooting a pistol.
Their enormous claws launch cannonballs of water powerful enough to pierce tanker hulls.
They make their home in deserts. They can generate their energy from basking in the sun, so eating food is not a requirement.
They flare their frills and generate energy. A single Heliolisk can generate sufficient electricity to power a skyscraper.
This Pokémon was restored from a fossil. If something happens that it doesn't like, it throws a tantrum and runs wild.
Thanks to its gargantuan jaws, which could shred thick metal plates as if they were paper, it was invincible in the ancient world it once inhabited.

It sends a soothing aura from its ribbonlike feelers to calm fights.

In order to support its flower, which has grown larger due to Mega Evolution, its back and legs have become stronger.
The overwhelming power that fills its entire body causes it to turn black and creates intense blue flames.
Its bond with its Trainer is the source of its power. It boasts speed and maneuverability greater than that of a jet fighter.
The cannon on its back is as powerful as a tank gun. Its tough legs and back enable it to withstand the recoil from firing the cannon.

Great to see you again, %PLAYERNAME%. I always run into you when I find something exciting. Maybe you’re my Special Research good-luck charm!
Last night, I was studying the chemical reaction that causes Trubbish to appear.
Suddenly I saw bright flashing lights in the near distance and went to investigate.
When I arrived at the site, I noticed a lot of damage to the ground and the surrounding area.
At first, the damage looked to be caused by Trainers practicing for the GO Battle League, but my gut told me to investigate further in the morning.
While I look into this, can you help me research Normal-type Pokémon? Some of the damage looks like it was caused by a Normal-type attack.
Thanks for getting that baseline research taken care of for me, %PLAYERNAME%. I have some updates to share with you.
After I returned to the site we’re studying, I realized there was actually a trail of damage.
When I followed that trail, I started finding areas that were clearly burned.
That damage must have been done by a Fire-type Pokémon—or at least a Pokémon that knows Fire-type attacks.
You know what this means, Trainer! Time to research Fire-type Pokémon.
The more information we have about this type of Pokémon, the more clues we’ll have to determine whatever did all this damage.
Meanwhile, I’ll continue following the trail of damage.
Thanks, %PLAYERNAME%! You’ve been on fire when it comes to getting these research tasks done! Get it? You’re on fire?
Anyway...the damage can’t have been caused by a Trainer Battle. I’ve never seen anything like it before. It seems almost...unnatural?
Could it really have been caused by Pokémon? This is getting fascinating! Could you do some research on Water-type Pokémon for me?
As I followed the damage trail further, the burned area suddenly ended and strange water damage started appearing, and it just doesn’t seem to line up with any Pokémon I’ve encountered.
%PLAYERNAME%, I’m so glad you’re back! We might have stumbled upon something incredible.
I contacted one of my colleagues in the Unova region.
She shared some notes about a Mythical Pokémon called Genesect that was restored from a 300-million-year-old fossil and then altered.
Pretty cool, huh? The notes say that though this Pokémon is Bug and Steel type, it’s known to be able to use attacks with types like Fire and Water, among others.
This lines up with the damage at the site we’ve been researching!
One of the other types Genesect can attack with is Electric, and as I kept following the damage trail, I found spots that must have been hit by some kind of high-voltage Electric-type attack.
I’ll see if anything else lies even farther down the trail, but in the meantime, I know I can count on you to start investigating Electric-type Pokémon to help us get to the bottom of this.
I can’t thank you enough for your help, %PLAYERNAME%. You really are my Special Research good-luck charm!
With the information you collected combined with the notes from Unova, I think we’ve uncovered the Bug- and Steel-type Pokémon Genesect!
I know what you’re thinking: Bug AND Steel with such odd attack types?
Apparently, when this Pokémon is holding a specially developed item called a Drive, its Techno Blast attack changes to a type that corresponds to the Drive the Pokémon’s holding.
I wonder what kinds of Drives exist for this Pokémon.
I still have so many questions, but for now, why not do a little research on Ice-type Pokémon? I hear Ice is another type Genesect can wield.
You ought to take a snapshot of Genesect to commemorate your meeting, too!
Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%. Good to see you again. Your research inspired me to do some more research of my own, and I think I’ve come across something...groundbreaking.
I was investigating the digging patterns of Diglett, and I wound up heading deep into a cave. Inside, I came across some unusual markings carved heavily into the cavern walls.
At first, I thought them to be random, but then I realized the carvings formed four unique patterns, each consisting of seven circles.
These patterns look incredibly familiar, and I think we need to take a closer look at some Pokémon in particular.
Can I count on you to help me research some Rock-type Pokémon?  I have a hunch that this will lead us to our first clue.
Simply amazing! The pattern on the Regirock you caught matches perfectly with the first pattern of carvings on the cave walls.
This leads me to believe we should move our investigation to Ice-type Pokémon. I wonder if we’ll find another Pokémon that will help us solve this puzzle.
I have one in mind, but I don’t want to get ahead of myself!
I’m sure with the help of an accomplished Trainer such as yourself, we’ll be on our way to figuring this out in no time.
As expected, Regice clearly has similar markings to the second carving I found in the cave.
I remember an ancient legend that told a story about a Colossal Pokémon. It’s said that it made Pokémon that looked like itself from a special ice mountain, rocks, and magma.
Could it be these Pokémon these patterns originate from? This is starting to get exciting, isn’t it?
If the first two Pokémon were Regirock and Regice...then there’s only one left that we must research further.
Excellent work. I believe we’re going in the right direction. This could only mean one thing, %PLAYERNAME%.
We’re close to coming across the Legendary Pokémon Regigigas! According to legend, this Pokémon towed continents with rope.
Maybe it can help move my research lab next time it gets stuck. Hahaha!
Anyway...I have a feeling that once you fully document these amazing creatures, you’ll make a colossal discovery of your own.
Welcome to GO Fest 2019, %PLAYERNAME%! I’m glad you’re here.
I discovered something fascinating during my research, and I need your help. I’ve come across what I believe to be a rare Pokémon deep in slumber.
We have our work cut out for us, %PLAYERNAME%. I think this adventure is going to call for some resources and even the help of some friends.
Could you collect some supplies? Meanwhile, I’ll see if I can find anything about this Pokémon in any of my texts.
Good work, %PLAYERNAME%. I’m sure the resources you’ve earned will be crucial.
I had some success in my research, as well. I came across an ancient text containing the story of a Mythical Pokémon that grants wishes.
I’m still researching the best way to awaken this Pokémon, but I keep hearing reports of other Pokémon in the area showing signs of distress.
Could I ask you to investigate these reports?
Well done, %PLAYERNAME%! I knew I could count on you. You know, something interesting came up when I reviewed your results.
Many of the Pokémon you encountered seem to have strayed from their habitats.
I’d like you to help them get back to their proper habitats, as I’m sure this will soothe them and make them more comfortable. This should be a breeze for an accomplished Trainer like you!
As you return the Pokémon to their proper habitats, be sure to snap pictures to help document this unusual situation.
Wonderful work, %PLAYERNAME%! You’re certainly getting the hang of that camera! Did you notice anything strange while taking photos of Pokémon in their habitats?
Apparently there’s an unusual phenomenon where Pokémon leap out in an attempt to appear in your photos. I’ve heard Spark refer to it as a “photobomb.”
I’m eternally amused—and amazed—by the things we learn about Pokémon every day. That said, I did notice a connection.
These Pokémon all seem to have something in common—music! I have a hunch that music may be the key to awakening our slumbering Pokémon.
What do you think, %PLAYERNAME%? Shall we set the stage and see if some beautiful music is the answer to this perplexing situation?
That’s it! The pure melody created by your musical Pokémon has awakened the Steel- and Psychic-type Pokémon Jirachi!
The ancient text was right—this Mythical Pokémon could only be awakened from its thousand-year slumber by a song of purity. The text also says that when Jirachi awakens, it grants wishes!
Now that we’ve done the work of waking Jirachi up, I wonder what you and your fellow Trainers will wish for. I already know what my wish is going to be—I want you to enjoy this amazing experience!
It isn’t every day that you get to join Trainers from all over the world in exploring a park with so many Pokémon in such diverse habitats—not to mention meeting a Mythical Pokémon!
I’m sure Jirachi was far from the last amazing discovery to be made, though. I’ll no doubt be calling on your excellent research skills again in the future!
Nice to see you again, %PLAYERNAME%! I’m excited to get started on our next big adventure.
What do we need to do? Well, I’ve come across something amazing, and I need your help.
We’re going to focus our efforts on Pokémon originally discovered in the Hoenn region, because I have some leads on a Pokémon I’ve never seen before!
First, we need to get some baseline research to help track this Pokémon.
Can you explore the area? Who knows—you might make some friends along the way.
Great job, Trainer. Your work helped me get a better understanding of the search area for this mysterious Pokémon. I can’t wait to show you what I’ve been working on.
A few weeks ago, I came across an ancient text that was found in the Hoenn region. It was filled with fascinating information.
It mentions a Mythical Pokémon that awakens once every thousand years and has the ability to grant wishes!
I really want to get a deeper understanding of this text, and how better to do that than with some research? Can you help me collect some information on Pokémon from the Hoenn region?
Thanks for your help, %PLAYERNAME%. Your Hoenn Pokédex is really looking great!
The Whismur you caught reminded me of a line from the text I told you about. It mentioned that a melody or a sound can awaken a sleeping Pokémon.
That gives me an idea... Let’s do a little experiment. There’s a sleeping Snorlax that hasn’t left my lab in months. And it’s right in front of my Berry stash!
Think we could wake it up with a loud noise? Let’s document the Whismur Evolution line, too—some photos will do.
Wow! That sure was loud, but it did the trick! Loudred worked just like an alarm clock for poor Snorlax.
I should make up for the rude awakening with some Berries... Well, we’ve learned something important here, and I think this method could work to awaken even the deepest of sleepers.
If my calculations are correct, the wish-granting Mythical Pokémon might be ready to awaken soon, and we should be prepared to do the waking!
The text says that the Pokémon is a Steel and Psychic type, so I think a good next step is to catch a few Pokémon with similar characteristics.
We’ll need a few extra hands to get this done, too. Could you get some fellow Trainers to help out?
Good work, %PLAYERNAME%. With the help of your research, I’ve been able to decipher more of this ancient text.
It says that when the Mythical Pokémon awakens, it will grant any wishes written on notes attached to its head.
Another interesting tidbit: If this Pokémon senses danger, it will fight without awakening. Up for a Trainer Battle, %PLAYERNAME%?
If the battle causes any reactions nearby, I have sensors set up to detect them. It might seem like a long shot, but I have a good feeling about this!
It worked! I’m picking up some vibrations nearby. I think we’re on the right track.
Maybe the Mythical Pokémon is close to awakening. Since what we’re doing is working, let’s keep it up.
We need to pull out all the stops, though, and the timing has to be just right.
I’ll hold things down here with Loudred while you keep focusing on encountering Steel- and Psychic-type Pokémon.
If you can do that, I think it’ll help the Mythical Pokémon see that you’re a worthy Trainer!
Simply astonishing! We encountered the Steel- and Psychic-type Pokémon Jirachi!
That was a once-in-a-lifetime experience. Well, once in several lifetimes, if Jirachi truly only wakes once every thousand years.
You’ve become such an accomplished Trainer, %PLAYERNAME%. Thank you for going on this amazing adventure with me.
You can bet I’ll be in touch whenever another exciting research project comes up. Until then, let’s get out there and GO!
How was 2019 for you, %PLAYERNAME%? For me, it was a fantastic year, and I want to thank you and all our Trainers around the world for your hard work.
Together, we took on Team GO Rocket, uncovered the Wish Pokémon, Jirachi, and began encountering Pokémon originally discovered in Unova.
I want to make sure you know how proud I am of how much you and all the other Trainers have grown this last year!
And now with 2020 on the horizon, there are sure to be many more adventures awaiting! Until then, let’s get up and GO!

Good to see you again, %PLAYERNAME%. Have you noticed an increased number of Abra in the area?
Yes, so did I. I originally thought this strange phenomenon was happening due to Abra’s ability to teleport.
When Abra decides to teleport randomly, it creates the illusion that it’s made copies of itself.
However, what’s happening right now really does seem to be a large number of Abra appearing in the wild! Let’s research more about Abra and see what we can discover about the Psi Pokémon!
Fantastic work, %PLAYERNAME%! Are you having difficulty catching Abra you encounter?
It’s said that you must clear your mind if you want to catch an Abra.
Or maybe you could ask your buddy for some catching assistance!
I’ve got a few more things about Abra that I could use your help researching. How about you give me a hand, and I’ll see if I can find a nice treat for your buddy?
I’m sure your buddy appreciates that delicious Poffin! I’m more of a Pinap Berry man myself.
While researching Abra, I read that it can sense danger and maintains a telepathic radar even while it’s sleeping! What amazing abilities!
Why don’t you keep researching? As a token of my thanks, I’ll give you one of the Rocket Radars I’ve developed.
While it won’t give you Abra’s ability to sense danger while sleeping, it will help you track down any trouble the Team GO Rocket Leaders are stirring up.
Thank you again, %PLAYERNAME%, for all your help today. It was incredible researching Abra with you.
We learned so much about this Psychic-type Pokémon. Rumor has it that some lucky Trainers even encountered Shiny Abra in the wild!
Pokémon are truly amazing creatures. There’s always something to discover.
Until next time, %PLAYERNAME%!
%PLAYERNAME%, you’ve been such a help in conducting Field Research and Special Research!
I have a feeling that there’s so much more about this world that we’ve yet to discover, and I’m glad I can count on you to see it through.
I’ve been doing some experiments of my own, and I suspect that I’m onto a further exciting discovery about another Mythical Pokémon that’s rarely seen.
Would you mind completing these tasks while I conclude my studies?
Please {0}, {1}, and {2}.
Wow, you and your Pokémon have some amazing power! But according to my most recent data, it seems that the Mythical Pokémon I’m tracking only appears in times of peace.
Also, from what I’ve gathered, it seems fond of forests and lush greens. Would you mind exploring this further, %PLAYERNAME%?
Let's {0}, {1}, and {2}.
Excellent work, %PLAYERNAME%! I feel we’re getting closer to this Mythical Pokémon. I wonder if we can find some more friends for it by hatching some Eggs.
Ah, and maybe you could put that Sun Stone you’ve earned to good use as well?
Please {0}, {1}, and {2}.
Oh wow, is that an Eevee you’ve caught? Perfect timing!
Did you know that this Pokémon’s unstable genetic makeup enables it to take on one of several different Evolutions?
I’ll bet if you spend some time with it during the day, you’ll be able to evolve your Eevee into an Espeon—a Psychic-type Pokémon just like the Mythical Pokémon I’m researching!
Can you {0}, {1}, and {2}?
Oh wow, is that an Eevee you’ve caught? Perfect timing!
Wait... Have we...had this conversation already? I’m getting a funny feeling in the back of my mind—like we’ve been here before.
%PLAYERNAME%, would you spend some time with this Eevee during the night? I think you’ll be able to see an intriguing evolved form as a result.
I wonder if this funny feeling will recur...
Please {0}, {1}, and {2}.
%PLAYERNAME%, I have some exciting news! That funny feeling hasn’t returned, but I did some important reading and learned that the Mythical Pokémon we’re researching has the ability to travel across time!
Maybe that’s why all of this is occurring...or recurring... Maybe this Pokémon is nearby?!
I suggest that you collect samples over the course of the next week and experiment with some Evolution items to see whether that feeling occurs again.
While you’re at it, do you have any Pinap Berries? My research could benefit from more data on their use. Return with that, and you can have these exotic Silver Pinap Berries!
Please {0}, {1}, and {2}.
This data is so helpful. Thank you! I’ll use it to explore my theory.
While you were in the field, I made more headway in learning about this Mythical Pokémon, and it seems that its mere presence causes grass and trees to flourish.
I think if you catch more Grass-type Pokémon, this elusive time-traveling Pokémon will reveal itself!
Let's {0}, {1}, and {2}.
%PLAYERNAME%, what an amazing experience! The appearance of the Mythical Pokémon Celebi is thought to be a sign that a bright and shining future awaits us.
You’ve come a long way in your research, and I must say you’re inspiring me to discover even more Pokémon. Until next time, %PLAYERNAME%!
Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! I hope you and your fellow Trainers have been taking care of yourselves. Remember to take a break every now and then to do something you really enjoy! I like to go on short walks, myself.
In fact, I was out for a stroll with my Buddy Pokémon earlier when I heard a strange crackling sound.
Upon further inspection, I realized it was a large group of Charmander gathered in an open field! The source of the noise was the soft crackling of their tail flames.
Seeing so many Charmander at once was highly unusual, though this wasn’t the first time I’ve witnessed such a gathering...
Well, whatever the reason, this is the perfect chance to learn more about Charmander!
Would you mind giving me a hand by catching some, Trainer?
Wonderful work, Trainer.
While you were out in the field, I looked through some research focused on Charmander and its Evolutionary line and came away with some interesting information.
For starters, Charmander is also known as the Lizard Pokémon and seems to be fond of hot things. You can tell how a Charmander is feeling by looking at the flame burning at the tip of its tail. What a fascinating Pokémon!
Hmmm... Perhaps those Charmander I ran into while walking were gathered to enjoy the sun? We may be able to learn more by evolving one.
Charmander’s evolved form is Charmeleon—but be careful when evolving Charmander! Charmeleon is known for its fiery temper!
That’s a fine Charmeleon you’ve got with you, %PLAYERNAME%!
Known as the Flame Pokémon, Charmeleon is hotheaded by nature and is constantly seeking out worthy opponents for battle.
When it finally encounters a worthy foe, it becomes so excited that the flame at the tip of its tail flares up and turns a bluish-white color.
The easiest way to calm a Charmeleon down is by winning a battle. That sure sounds like a certain team leader I know!
Now, did you know Charmeleon can evolve? Not only that, but its evolved form, Charizard, is also known as the Flame Pokémon! Come back and see me once you’ve evolved your Charmeleon.
Congrats, Trainer! Your Charmeleon has now become the Flame Pokémon Charizard!
Charizard is a truly amazing Pokémon. Its wings can carry it close to an altitude of 4,600 feet, and its fiery breath packs such great heat that it can melt almost anything!
While all that raw power seems intimidating, Charizard never turns its flames on any opponent weaker than itself.
What a superb display of control! It’s amazing to see how this Pokémon chooses to take on only the mightiest of opponents!
They say the key to a successful partnership is a powerful bond, Trainer, so why not celebrate by spending a little time with your new Charizard?
I can see you’re really putting an effort into strengthening the bond between you and your Pokémon, %PLAYERNAME%. Did you know that that bond can become a source of power for certain Pokémon? That’s right—I’m talking about Mega Evolution!
Mega Evolution is the result of a strong connection between a Pokémon and its Trainer. Charizard is unique not only because it can Mega Evolve but also because it has two different Mega-Evolved forms!
Its two Mega Evolutions, Mega Charizard X and Mega Charizard Y, each come with their own strengths.
It’s said that the overwhelming power dwelling within Mega Charizard X is so intense that it turns its body black and causes blue flames to spill from its mouth.
Other research suggests that Mega Charizard Y uses its bond with its Trainer as the source of its power, resulting in speed and maneuverability greater than that of a fighter jet’s.
Simply amazing! I can’t wait to see how Trainers use these Mega Evolutions in their Gym battle strategies!
Thanks again for your help, %PLAYERNAME%. I’ll be in touch as soon as I have more exciting research to share!
Hello there, %PLAYERNAME%! It’s so great to see you. Can you believe this year is already coming to a close?
It’s almost as if Pokémon in the wild can feel it, too. A few seem to be appearing in greater numbers than usual!
Strangely enough, the Pokémon appearing more frequently at the moment seem to be the same as those that did so previously throughout this year.
Seeing all these Abra, Rhyhorn, and Piplup in the wild is making me a bit nostalgic. We’ve had quite a year, haven’t we?
As you venture out to catch these Pokémon, I think it might be nice to reminisce on some of the highlights from this year and how much you’ve grown as a Pokémon Trainer along the way.
Who knows—you might even surprise yourself!
Great job catching all those Abra, Rhyhorn, and Piplup, Trainer.
As you were doing that, I was busy thinking about all we’ve accomplished together this year.
We discovered the secrets of trade Evolution and met a vast variety of Pokémon originally discovered in the Unova region.
We even encountered Legendary Pokémon like Tornadus, Thundurus, Reshiram, Zekrom, Landorus, and Kyurem!
Then there were the Pokémon originally discovered in the Galar region. I was particularly excited to see Galarian Ponyta, Galarian Rapidash, and Sirfetch’d!
Oh! And who could forget the mysterious appearance of Mega-Evolved Pokémon?
Hard to believe we fit all that into one year, eh, %PLAYERNAME%?
Anyway, I’ve rambled on long enough. It’s time for you to get back out there and catch some more Pokémon!
Ah—Weedle, Gastly, and Seedot. The stars of some memorable days this past year! I still get a bit jumpy at the sight of acorns. Haha!
Gastly gave us a bit of a fright as well. Remember?
OOOooooOOOoooo... BOO! Haha, sorry—I couldn’t help it.
You know, Gastly isn’t the only gaseous thing we saw in abundance this year.
That’s right—I’m talking about Team GO Rocket taking to the sky in balloons! An almost cartoonish mode of transportation, and yet surprisingly effective.
You know, if the members of Team GO Rocket weren’t so devoted to villainy, their assets and energy would likely make them great allies.
I hope that world comes to be someday.
Ah, pardon my wistfulness. I tend to get more and more pensive as the day wears on. Does that happen to you as well?
Perhaps you can ponder that while you go out and catch more Pokémon, %PLAYERNAME%!
It’s certainly been an interesting year, hasn’t it, %PLAYERNAME%? I can’t remember another one like it, and I’ve seen a few!
But despite all the ways it’s challenged us, I can’t help but think that it’ll make future experiences feel even more precious and special.
After all, no matter what happens, we’re all on this Pokémon journey together—every Trainer, regardless of where they are in the world.
That’s truly something special.
So when the going gets tough, remember that you’re not in this alone. And while bad days are inevitable, I like to think they make the good ones that much sweeter.
I hope today has been one of the good ones for you!
The world is ever changing, %PLAYERNAME%. What doesn’t change, however, is the fact that we have each other and our Pokémon.
And as the mysterious world of Pokémon continues to grow, so do we—as Trainers, as a community, and as people.
So here’s to a year for the books—and many more exciting ones to come!
Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! I’m really glad to see you.
I’ve been dealing with some strange power outages in my mobile lab and wanted to investigate what could be causing them.
It didn’t take me long to find the cause. Seems as though a group of Electabuzz decided that the mobile lab’s electricity would make an excellent snack.
Electabuzz seem to be appearing in higher numbers, which could lead to more outages.
Do you think you could catch some of these Pokémon?
The research would be valuable, and I’d be grateful to have my power restored!
Welcome back, Trainer.
Thanks for the assistance—I really appreciate it! While you were out catching Electabuzz, I did some research on this Pokémon’s Evolutionary line.
Did you know that Electabuzz evolves from Elekid?
A weak electric current flows between Elekid’s horns. Be careful, Trainer! Sticking a hand between its horns will shock you!
Hmm... I wonder whether Spark has tried that with his Buddy Pokémon...
Anyway, let’s keep researching these Electabuzz and make sure they aren’t snacking on any electricity meant for other uses!
Great work, %PLAYERNAME%. I think we have enough data on Electabuzz.
Also known as the Electric Pokémon, it loves to feed on strong electricity. That explains why so many Electabuzz were attracted to my mobile lab.
Electricity runs across the surface of Electabuzz’s body. In darkness, its entire body glows a whitish blue.
Simply amazing! Let’s continue our research. Go ahead and use a Sinnoh Stone to evolve Electabuzz into Electivire!
I can’t wait to see what electrifying facts we’ll learn about that Evolution!
I just don’t ever know whether they find my jokes funny... Should I take a comedy class?
OH! I didn’t see you there, %PLAYERNAME%. I see you’ve evolved your Electabuzz into Electivire like I asked. Thank you!
According to the Pokédex, as Electivire’s electric charge amplifies, blue sparks begin to crackle between its horns.
When in battle, Electivire pushes the tips of its two tails against its foe, then lets loose with over 20,000 volts of power. I guess you could say its opponent is in for a shock!
Be careful with this Pokémon when battling with it—that’s a lot of power you’re dealing with!
With the lights back on in the mobile lab, I’m going to head back and wrap up some other projects.
Thank you again for all your help, and until next time, let’s GO!
Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%. How’s your day?
Personally, mine is going swimmingly. Or perhaps…flappingly? You see, an enormous flock of Fletchling has gathered nearby.
I heard some Pokémon chirping up a storm, so I went to investigate and found Fletchling as far as the eye can see!
Fletchling is known as the Tiny Robin Pokémon, and it’s typically quite amiable and easy to train. Send it into battle, though, and you’ll quickly see its more ferocious side!
A fascinating little Pokémon. But as glad as I am to see it here, it’s quite odd for so many to gather in one place.
Would you mind conducting some research so we can better understand what’s going on?
Great work, Trainer. Looks like you’ve got your very own Fletchling to join you on your journey!
Did you know that Fletchling’s body is always warm? In fact, Trainers who live in cold areas apparently sleep with this Pokémon in their beds. How about that?
I’m always fascinated to learn about how Pokémon and their Trainers work and live together. And it never hurts to know how to cope on cold nights, eh?
Anyway, Fletchling evolves into the Fire- and Flying-type Pokémon Fletchinder.
Known as the Ember Pokémon, Fletchinder is exceedingly territorial and aggressive.
It’s also incredibly fast. Its speed from takeoff puts it easily among the fastest of all bird Pokémon.
When you’re ready, why don’t you try evolving your Fletchling into Fletchinder? I’d love to witness that famous speed firsthand!
That’s a mighty fine Fletchinder you have there, %PLAYERNAME%. Congratulations!
Naturally, I’ve been busy as well. In fact, I have some information you may find useful as you train Fletchinder.
You see, Fletchinder is known to expel embers from its beak to set grass on fire. Then, it pounces on the bewildered prey that flee the flames.
Pretty intense, huh? Best not to wing it during training, if you catch my draft—er, drift.
Try not to let any fires Fletchinder starts get out of hand, too. We’re all responsible for caring for our environment, after all!
With that said, there are still a few more tasks I’d like you to complete in aid of our research.
Chief among those is to obtain a Talonflame, the evolution of Fletchinder. They’re said to have simply magnificent wings! Do you think you could evolve your Fletchinder, Trainer?
Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%—and hello, Talonflame!
I know I’ve put you through your paces today, but it’s all paid off in the end! You’re now the proud Trainer of Talonflame, the Scorching Pokémon.
Talonflame is known to shower embers from the gaps between its feathers during the heat of battle. It then takes to the air, reaching speeds of up to 310 mph.
Remember how I mentioned Talonflame’s wings before? Fire can’t pass through them, so they were used to outfit firefighters way back when.
Amazing stuff! I’m always impressed by this brave bird. The two of you will no doubt accomplish great things—and at great speeds!
Thanks for your help today, Trainer. I hope you had as much fun as I did!
Now, let’s GO!
%PLAYERNAME%! It’s so great to see you! The strangest things have been happening lately.
You see, I begin each day with a Pinap Berry and coffee for breakfast, then head outside my lab to take in the crisp morning air before starting my research.
A couple days ago, however, I stepped outside and slipped on a sheet of ice right outside the entrance of my lab! Coffee—spilled. Pinap Berry—squished. Day—ruined.
At first, I thought the ice formed because it was an especially chilly day, but it was in fact nowhere near cold enough to create a sheet of ice that thick!
For my sake—and my breakfast’s—can you help me research Ice-type Pokémon to see whether we can discover anything? *sniffle* My poor breakfast...
Great work, %PLAYERNAME%! We’ve learned quite a bit about Ice-type Pokémon, and it looks as if you’ve caught a few interesting ones!
I feel like we’re getting closer to finding out the cause of my breakfast’s untimely demise. Oh! There’s something I forgot to mention.
That very evening—after an incredibly sad, breakfast-less day—I was trying to cheer myself up by dressing in my comfiest pajamas and drinking a cup of herbal tea before tucking into bed.
As I lay there, ready to count Mareep and fall asleep, I was suddenly awoken by some unnerving tapping outside my lab! It sounded like...tap-dancing?
I was simply too comfortable in bed—and too frightened—to get up and check. All I could do was lie there and hope the tapping would end soon.
I now believe source of that tapping was the same Pokémon that created the sheet of ice in front of my mobile lab.
Can you investigate some Pokémon related to making peculiar sounds? Let’s see whether we can get closer to solving this case before it goes cold.
... ... ... OH! %PLAYERNAME%, you scared me. I was a bit distracted thinking about the tap-dancing I heard last night, as well as the shadow I saw pass by my window.
Oh, I didn’t mention that last part? Yes, it was quite an unnerving experience! Anyway, let me take a look at all the research you’ve done.
Oh! OH! Oh my goodness! All right, I think I know the source of these strange occurrences now.
I believe the culprit is the Galarian form of the Barrier Pokémon—Mr. Mime!
Galarian Mr. Mime is known as the Dancing Pokémon. It likes to create a sheet of ice and tap-dance on it. What a strange Pokémon!
While Galarian Mr. Mime is the prime suspect, it’s still just a hunch. Can you go out and do a bit more research to confirm? Maybe you might even come across a Galarian Mr. Mime!
Phew! Great job catching that Galarian Mr. Mime, %PLAYERNAME%! I guess it’s not as frightening as I first thought.
Perhaps it’ll become even more approachable when it evolves?
I’ve read that Galarian Mr. Mime evolves into Mr. Rime, the Comedian Pokémon. Mr. Rime is apparently highly skilled at tap-dancing and waves its cane of ice in time with its graceful movements.
I wonder whether it could teach me some new moves. Haha! Anyway, how about you try evolving your Galarian Mr. Mime?
What a fascinating Pokémon Mr. Rime is! Thank you for evolving your Galarian Mr. Mime, %PLAYERNAME%.
I've heard stories of Mr. Rime’s amusing movements, and you know what? Color me amused. What a COOL discovery this was!
This has definitely been an unforgettable adventure, but I’m not sure I can say I’d do it again, given the chilling way it started. My poor breakfast...
Until next time, %PLAYERNAME%. Let’s GO!
%PLAYERNAME%! Excellent timing.
I just made a tremendously exciting discovery!
Earlier today, I was exploring a nearby cave to collect some samples when I noticed a peculiar warmth along one of the walls.
Suddenly, something jumped out and tried to bite me!
I quickly realized I had stumbled upon a nest of Gible, the Land Shark Pokémon. Gible is known to react to anything that moves, so sometimes it leaps out and chomps passersby.
I know it just wanted a nibble, but that’s a nibble too much in my book!
Anyway, it’s not every day you run into a gaggle of Gible. Do you think you could head out and do some research on their appearance here?
Welcome back, Trainer.
While you were out tracking down the Land Shark Pokémon, I took a closer look at the cave I was telling you about earlier.
I was reminded of an interesting tidbit about Gible. It nests inside small, horizontal holes in cave walls warmed by geothermal heat.
Gible seems to love warm places, and that cave certainly fits the bill.
We’ve learned a lot about this Dragon- and Ground-type Pokémon, but there’s always more to discover!
When you’re ready, how about you try evolving your Gible into Gabite?
Nice job evolving your Gible into Gabite, %PLAYERNAME%!
Gabite is known as the Cave Pokémon, and it loves sparkly things.
It emits ultrasonic waves from protrusions on either side of its head to probe pitch-dark caves.
What a useful ability! Maybe it could help me avoid bumping into lab equipment in the middle of the night...
We’ve seen Gible and Gabite, but there’s still one more Evolution we need to document. Come see me when you’ve evolved your Gabite, Trainer!
Ah! Fantastic work, %PLAYERNAME%. That’s an admirable Garchomp!
Known as the Mach Pokémon, its body is covered in fine scales that reduce drag, enabling it to fly at high speeds.
Those scales don’t just reduce wind resistance—their sharp edges also cause injury to any opponent that touches them. Pretty spiffy, eh?
I think you’ll find Garchomp to be a powerful companion on your adventures.
And I can’t wait to see how your relationship develops along the way!
Thanks for all your help today, Trainer. I hope you had a fin-tastic time!
Now, let’s GO!
%PLAYERNAME%! Thank goodness you made it.
I was ready for a fun-filled day of playing with Pokémon, but as you may have seen, the park has all sorts of unusual geological phenomena occurring!
We need to figure out what’s happening and set it right, so I'm asking for your help.
Now that you’re here, I need you to be part of my Elite Research team.
First things first—could you help survey the park and get some supplies?
Please complete the following research tasks.{0}{1}{2}
Yowzers! As you may have noticed, the park has all sorts of unusual geological phenomena going on today!
I’m not sure what could have caused it—they just appeared out of nowhere...and they seem to be getting bigger and bigger!
Whatever is causing it, the local park habitat here is quite disrupted by all the changes.
The local Pokémon have become confused… It looks like they’re acting more aggressive and territorial!
Let's see if we can help out by catching some Pokémon to make the situation a bit more stable.
Please catch some Fire-, Steel-, Water-, Grass-, Rock-, and Ice-type Pokémon!
Well, it looks like there were some pretty powerful Pokémon causing the ruckus. Thanks for taking care of them! I'm sure they'll make great friends.
However, I'm not sure that was sufficient—the strange habitats are just as active as before. The local park and all the Pokémon here seem worried. We need to get to the bottom of this!
I've been seeing some unusual Pokémon called Unown floating around the area...
This Pokémon is shaped like ancient writing…and I think they may be trying to tell us something! I think they want us to call on a powerful Pokémon—the Guardian of the Forest? I'll bet if we follow the Unown around the park, they'll lead us to this Pokémon!
Let's do the following research tasks.{0}{1}{2}
Amazing! Never thought I would see Celebi here.
I think Celebi's time travel abilities may be exactly what we need to fix the situation.
Celebi can go back in time and stop these distortions while they're still small!
It's a difficult task… We need to ensure Celebi has all the support it needs!
The Plusle and Minun in the park would be perfect to help us out.
These Pokémon are famous for loving teamwork and cheering on their partners with their pom-poms made of sparks!
If we collect a bunch, I think they'll be able to work together to get Celebi really pumped up!
Then Celebi can focus its power to return to the past and prevent this problem before it starts!
Quickly, %PLAYERNAME%, let's complete these research tasks!{0}{1}
That did it! It seems like the strange habitats are slowly returning to normal.
It appears that Celebi has safely returned from the past to stay with you. Looks like you two have formed a bond!
I'll bet by next weekend the park will have returned to its old self! Celebi is truly a wondrous Pokémon!
Thanks for all your help today! We couldn't have done it without you.
This weekend will be one to remember!
Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! I’m glad you’re here. Something odd is happening, and I need your help investigating it.
While I was on a walk last night with my Buddy Pokémon, Meltan, I noticed a strange light flickering in my mobile lab. It was so spooky! One might’ve called it...a ghastly sight!
Apparently, some Gastly were in my mobile lab hiding from the wind. It’s common for them to take shelter when massive gusts are blowing about so their gaseous bodies aren’t blown away.
However, the sheer number of Gastly seemed unusual. They’re still in the mobile lab, so could you help me look into this situation?
Thanks, %PLAYERNAME%! While you were helping with our research, I was assisting the Gastly in the mobile lab.
I had to be careful when I got near the Gastly. I didn’t want to be engulfed by their gaseous bodies!
Now that the Gastly are out of the mobile lab, I think it’s time for us to start looking into Gastly’s Evolution.
I’ve done some reading on the matter, and I think we’ll need to prepare for a dangerous Pokémon.
Excellent work, %PLAYERNAME%. Seems as though your Gastly has evolved into Haunter. I had a feeling I was being watched.
It’s said that Haunter lurks in walls to keep an eye on its foes, but in this case, I have a feeling it’s just being playful.
I’ve noticed the team leaders tripping and stumbling around the lab today. Seems as if Haunter is having a bit of fun with them, but I don’t think Blanche is amused.
Let’s go ahead and fix that problem by evolving Haunter.
Congrats, Trainer. Your Haunter has now become the Shadow Pokémon, Gengar! Are you ready for a spooky story? Let me get my flashlight.
If you ever see your shadow suddenly and startlingly overtake you, it might be a Gengar running past you, pretending to be your shadow!
Do you feel that chill in the air? That means a Gengar is near. OOOoooOOOooo...
BOO!
Hahaha, got you, %PLAYERNAME%! I crack myself up. Although...it looked for a second like there was a ghostly hand on your shoulder... Maybe it was just my imagination.
Anyway, I know an accomplished Trainer such as yourself has nothing to fear when it comes to training a Pokémon like Gengar. Being both Poison- and Ghost-type, it’s a fantastic Pokémon to have on your team.
Thanks to your help, I think we all learned something today! I’ll be in touch when I have another adventure for you!
BOO! Haha, hey there, %PLAYERNAME%!
Hope I didn’t scare you too badly. I was just having a bit of fun during this spooky season.
Say, since you’re here, I was wondering whether you could help me. I’ve heard some reports of an unusual Pokémon appearing in a nearby forest.
Why aren’t I going into that dark forest to find this Pokémon myself? W-well, er, it’s certainly not because I’m scared!
Y-you see I would, but I’m busy here with some...uh...research! Yes!
Oh! I think I see Blanche over there near my lab. Maybe it’s time for some research into the Evolution of Ghost-type Pokémon!
Could you go on ahead and let me know what you find, %PLAYERNAME%? Thanks—and good luck!
Blanche, do you really think this Galarian Pokémon can evolve? Oh, glad to see you again, %PLAYERNAME%— AH!
What’s that sound?! Oh, it’s just a Yamask. Seems like it’s looking at its mask and crying.
Ah, so Yamask was the unusual Pokémon appearing in the forest? I see. Sorry, Trainer, but it looks like you’re going to have to venture back out there.
After comparing eyewitness reports with some texts I found about Ghost-type Pokémon, it turns out we aren’t looking for this particular kind of Yamask, which was originally discovered in the Unova region, but another one entirely!
The Yamask we’re looking for was first discovered in the Galar region and seems to be carrying a clay slab. The texts say that the slab absorbs that Yamask’s dark power.
Unfortunately, I can’t come along with you this time, either. Because, uh...it looks like Spark needs my help with some Strange Eggs! See ya later, and good luck!
Yup, still seems like mostly Poison- and Dark-type Pokémon are hatching from Strange Eggs. I sure am glad we got to confirm what we already— Oh!
Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! How are— EGAD! A Spiritomb! What a tricky Ghost-type Pokémon.
I’ve worked with Trainers to research Spiritomb in previous years. Maybe you’ve encountered a Spiritomb before!
There seem to be a few more Spiritomb around than in the past. That’s quite frightening, given that each Spiritomb is formed by 108 spirits bound to a keystone.
One might say that it’s BOUND to be a real spooky season! Haha, sorry, Spiritomb—too much?
Anyway, I hate to ask you again, Trainer, but third time’s the charm, right? I’m sure you’ll encounter the illusive and elusive Galarian Yamask this time!
I, uh, have to go help Candela prep for an upcoming Trainer Battle, but you go on ahead! Good luck, %PLAYERNAME%!
Poison-, Bug-, Ghost-, Dark-, and Fairy-type Pokémon—looks like you’re all set for a spooky Trainer Battle, Candela!
Oh, hi there, %PLAYERNAME%! And hello, Galarian Yamask! What a curious Pokémon this is. It gives off a totally different energy.
Blanche and I were looking into the Evolution of Ghost-type Pokémon earlier, and it appears that Galarian Yamask evolves into an entirely different Pokémon than its counterpart from Unova does!
All you need is to collect some Yamask Candies and get to evolving! I’m certain that its Evolution will be an exciting addition to your Pokédex!
Anyway, I’m so glad we got to go on this spooky adventure and discover Galarian Yamask together!
I hope you had a ghoulishly good time, and I hope you have an extra spoOoOoOoOoOoky day!
Jessie: Hey, James, did you hear?
James: What is it, Jessie?
Jessie: Apparently, there’s a mysterious Pokémon in a jungle nearby!
James: Go on!
Jessie: They say it’s called the Protector of the Jungle or something like that.
James: Oh? That sounds like the kind of Pokémon the Boss would be happy to see!
Jessie: It’s going to be a pain, though, since we don’t really know the area.
James: Hmmm, maybe we can con someone into helping us!
Jessie: Yeah... Huh? Hey, you! You must be an assistant the Boss sent! Yeah, why else would someone be out here in the middle of nowhere?
James: Assistant? Oh! Of course! An assistant! The Boss has high expectations for us, after all. Now that you’re here, let’s get to work.
Jessie: Nice work, kid! I can’t believe you actually did it!
James: Yeah! It feels nice to have somebody to boss around— I mean, uh, somebody to help us out! Jessie and I are constantly on our feet, you know.
Jessie: As you can imagine, it’s hard for us to maintain our good looks when we’re always running around like this. Anyway, you did your bit, so I guess we can let you take a little break.
James: Superb idea, Jessie! It’s important to change up the pace every once in a while!
James: Go on and spend some time with your buddy.
Jessie: I’m so glad the Boss sent along someone so useful to help us!
James: Now that you mention it, you haven’t told us anything about yourself. Where are you normally stationed? How long have you been with Team Rocket? Oh, what’s your favorite thing about the Boss? Do tell!
James: Hey, who exactly are you?
James: ... ... ...
Jessie: You’d better start talking.
Jessie: Aha! I knew you were just a no-good Twerp! This whole thing was suspicious from the start! Did someone send you to get in our way?! Yeah, that must be it!
James: I trusted you! I thought you were one of us!
Jessie: You know too much! We can’t let you go! Let’s get ’em, James!
James: Don’t you dare get in our way! You’ll regret it if you do!
Jessie: Don’t you know who we are?! Well, let us formally introduce ourselves!
Jessie: Prepare for trouble...
James: And make it double!
Jessie: ...
Jessie: To protect the world from devastation!
James: To unite all people— HEY! Are you even listening?!
James: Hey, why so quiet all of a sudden?
James: Jessie, who actually told you that we’d be getting an assistant?
Jessie: Nobody told ME anything!
James: Well, no one told me, either!
Jessie: But you’re the one who said they were sent by the Boss!
James: I said no such thing!
James: ... ... ...
Jessie: I can’t believe we were defeated by a Twerp like you!
James: That was totally unexpected. What will the Boss say...?
James: Huh?!
Jessie: Hey, behind you! Isn’t that Celebi? Could it be the so-called Protector of the Jungle?!
James: Drat! That Pokémon was supposed to be ours!
Jessie: Mark our words...
James: We’ll get you next time!
Jessie: We’re blasting off again!
Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! Can I just say how impressed I am with your progress as a Trainer?
You’ve really put in the time and effort to become one of the very best. Well done!
Say, do you remember when we first met? You were just a beginner back then, and I sent you off to catch your very first Pokémon.
And look at you now! I’m glad we can share that memory together.
Now, I’m sure an elite Trainer like yourself has mastered the art of catching Pokémon, but it’s important to keep your skills sharp.
How about you head out and catch some Pokémon? I’ve assigned some tasks that should challenge even a Trainer of your caliber.
Good luck—and have fun!
Great work as always, Trainer.
I’m sure those tasks were a breeze for someone with your skills, but they were just a warm-up!
These next tasks should prove a bit more challenging.
I’m sure you’ve built special bonds with several Pokémon over the course of your adventures. You might even have a few Pokémon that you like to always bring into battles.
I’d like to see how powerful those bonds are. Why don’t you head out, challenge a few Team GO Rocket Grunts, and battle in some raids?
After all, the best Trainers never stop training!
Good luck!
How did it go, %PLAYERNAME%?
I’m sure you had a great time working with your closest Pokémon companions.
It’s always fascinating to see how Trainers and Pokémon work together, and I can tell that you take a lot of pride in training your team. Well done!
Say, why don’t you evolve some of the Pokémon you’ve caught so they can reach their full potential? You might even discover some new options for battles.
Enough about that, though—back to our research!
This next batch will test your Pokémon-catching skills again, but with a twist. Or perhaps I should say a curve? Haha! That’s right—you’ll need to test your skills with Curveball Throws!
Make sure to stretch your throwing arm!
Nice work, Trainer! I can tell you put a lot of effort into that research.
I have Blanche assisting me with the analysis and care of all those Pokémon you sent over. It’s an impressive display of your progress, Trainer, and it’s caught Blanche’s eye as well.
Anyway, I should probably get back to work.
But before I go, I want to say how nice it was to reminisce about our first memories as professor and Trainer.
I’m truly proud of you and how much you’ve grown!
I know you’re far from finished on that front, too, so I’ll be watching closely as you progress and checking in whenever I have more challenges for you.
Until then, %PLAYERNAME%...let’s GO!
Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! I wanted to check in on your progress. It looks like you’ve grown even more as a Trainer since we last spoke!
As for me, I’ve been spending a lot of time with my Buddy Pokémon lately, and it’s helped me think of some new research opportunities.
Do you remember your first Buddy Pokémon? I remember mine—it was the mysterious Hex Nut Pokémon Meltan!
I still remember the day it earned its very own Best Buddy ribbon.
That’s a proud moment in any Trainer’s journey, don’t you think?
Meltan and I have been around the block a few times, but I still look forward to the next PokéStop we’ll visit.
Why don’t you and your buddy go out and visit some of your favorite places together?
Hope you enjoyed a few walks together with your buddy, Trainer. Did you come across any interesting PokéStops?
I was inspired to head outdoors myself. I joined Spark and his buddy for a long walk after he won a battle.
I even took a celebratory snapshot to mark the occasion!
Going on walks together can be a great way to strengthen your bond with your Pokémon. It’s also a wonderful form of exercise!
Seeing the bond Spark shares with his Pokémon gave me some ideas for more research. Oh, and Spark also wanted me to let you know that he’s cheering you on!
How about you and your buddy go out for a walk, challenge another Trainer and their Pokémon to battle, and take a few snapshots to capture some fun moments together?
Working hard is important, but so is savoring the memories made along the way! Have fun!
Did you make any fun memories with your Pokémon, %PLAYERNAME%?
I’m always amazed by the variety in the snapshots taken by Trainers from all over the world.
I’m especially fond of ones that capture surprise encounters with Pokémon like Smeargle!
That’s one of the best parts of taking snapshots—you never know what you’re going to see!
Hmm... That reminds me of when Team GO Rocket decided to start showing up in Trainers’ snapshots uninvited. And THAT reminds me of some more research I need your help with!
To start, why don’t you and your buddy get warmed up with some raids? When you’re ready, I think we’ll need some help clearing out the Team GO Rocket Leaders in the area.
They’re always up to something, so it’s good to keep an eye out in case they try to take over any nearby PokéStops. Good luck!
Fantastic work, %PLAYERNAME%.
The Team GO Rocket Leaders are a challenge for most Trainers, but I knew they wouldn’t stand a chance against you and your Buddy Pokémon!
The power of friendship is strong indeed—and just one of many benefits to building relationships with your Pokémon.
The trust between a Trainer and their Pokémon is unlike anything I’ve ever seen. Make sure to cherish it!
I’m glad I was able to check in on your progress, Trainer.
I’ll be back with more fun challenges as you continue your journey.
Until next time!
Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%.
I can see you’ve been working as hard as ever!
We’ve been doing a lot of reminiscing lately, haven’t we? I think it’s important to look back on your accomplishments from time to time—especially when you’ve accomplished so much!
A major moment for many Trainers is their first victory in battle.
It’s an unforgettable thrill that comes with a swell of pride for the Pokémon that sealed the victory.
How about you, %PLAYERNAME%? I’m sure you’ve got some epic battle stories to share with your fellow Trainers.
I’d like to focus on your battling skills for this next challenge. So to prepare, why don’t you get your team sorted and get in some throwing practice?
You clearly have some powerful Pokémon, Trainer.
You’ve done an amazing job training them! I wanted to see how your battling skills have progressed, so I consulted with Candela to get her thoughts.
I’m happy to report that she’s just as proud of you as I am!
For this next challenge, she suggested taking on some of her most difficult opponents—Team GO Rocket and its leaders.
The Team GO Rocket Leaders can be intimidating, so Candela asked me to pass along some extra guidance.
She said that when it comes to battling, you should take on your opponents with a cool head, strong Pokémon, and a heart full of passion.
With that in mind, I think it’s time for you to head out and put your skills to the test!
Wonderful work, %PLAYERNAME%! Your battling skills are even more impressive than the last time we talked.
Those skills are vital not only when you take on Team GO Rocket but also when you battle in raids. Do you remember your first raid, Trainer?
To me, there’s something special about a group of Trainers coming together to challenge a raid with their partner Pokémon.
There’s no questioning the importance of the bonds Trainers share with their Pokémon, but I think the bonds Trainers share with their peers are equally important.
No matter your skill level, what team you’re on, or the Pokémon you bring to battle, raids are about each Trainer working together to achieve a common goal. And that’s what the Trainer community is all about!
I hope that inspired you to head out and challenge some raids with your fellow Trainers—because that’s part of your next task!
It should be a fun challenge, so be sure to give it your best shot!
Excellent work, Trainer.
Did you enjoy spending time with your fellow Trainers as you completed your tasks?
Hopefully you even found a Pokémon that’ll make a great addition to your team!
I hope you continue making memories with Trainers from all over as you work together and explore this amazing world filled with Pokémon.
Very few Trainers have made it as far as you have. Be sure to take a moment to celebrate your progress.
And remember—the journey is just as important as the destination!
Until next time, %PLAYERNAME%!
I knew I’d see you here before long, %PLAYERNAME%.
But before we begin this challenge, let’s take a couple deep breaths together, shall we?
In... And out... One more time. In... And out... There, that’s better.
A few deep breaths go a long way when you need to clear your mind and focus on the task at hand—and you’ll need plenty of focus for what I’ll be throwing your way next.
Get it? “Throwing”? Ahem! Anyway... The sign of a truly great Trainer is their dedication to training, and true dedication takes time to prove.
Your next few tasks will take some time to complete, but don’t worry. Start with a deep breath, and be sure to enjoy yourself!
Training can be hard work, but don’t forget it’s supposed to be fun, too.
Impressive work, Trainer!
I don’t know many who would have the dedication and patience to complete those tasks.
Say, I was just thinking... Do you remember when you decided which team you wanted to join?
Trainers often form a strong connection to their team and become dedicated members. Others, however, eventually look to change teams in hopes of gaining a different perspective and a fresh challenge.
Everyone’s path is different, and I’ll always encourage you to find your own. There’s much to be learned from Team Instinct, Team Mystic, and Team Valor. Each team has its own unique characteristics and focus.
I urge you to learn from your fellow Trainers and respect their paths. It’s sure to help you become a better Trainer! After all, only when we understand others can we truly understand ourselves.
Now, back to your research. I have a feeling this next batch will truly test your resolve, so take your time—we’ll regroup when you’re finished!
Welcome back, Trainer. You certainly showed your dedication by completing those tasks.
Which did you find most difficult? And which was most fun?
We’re approaching the end of this challenge, and I’m not ashamed to say it’s making me a bit emotional! The team leaders and I feel an immense sense of pride when we see how much you’ve grown.
I hope you feel that pride in yourself, %PLAYERNAME%. To wrap up this challenge, each team leader wanted you to experience some of their most beloved activities.
Spark wants you to enjoy a walk with your buddy to enhance your bond, and Blanche hopes to remind you of the importance of research and analysis by asking you to evolve some of your Pokémon to their full potential.
As for Candela... Well, she wants to celebrate with you after you win some raids.
I think these are great tasks for a well-rounded Trainer like yourself. I’ll be here to congratulate you when you’re done!
Amazing. Simply amazing, %PLAYERNAME%! Let me be the first to congratulate you for completing this challenge. You’ve become a truly top-class Trainer, and it’s been an honor to work alongside you.
It’s been astonishing to witness the growth you’ve experienced since you began your journey as a Pokémon Trainer. You’re an incredible talent, and I hope you’ll put your skills to use.
You see, I want you to help other Trainers become the best they can be. Your experience comes with a lot of responsibility, and I hope you’ll continue to show kindness, patience, and friendship to those who could benefit from your guidance.
The world of Pokémon is a beautiful place, and I want you to lead by example and show everyone how amazing our community can be while protecting it from the likes of Team GO Rocket and anyone else who would threaten it.
Remember how it felt the first time you caught a Pokémon, the first time you took a walk with your buddy, the first time you challenged a raid—and channel that energy into everything you do. With your strong heart and peerless determination, there’s nothing you can’t do!
I can only hope you’re as proud of yourself as the team leaders and I are of you. Don’t worry—I’ll always be here when you need me, and you can be sure I’ll be calling on you from time to time to help me with research. There’s always something more to discover, after all!
Thanks for everything, %PLAYERNAME%. I know I can always count on you! And I’m sure you know what I’m about to say, so before I get too choked up—let’s GO!
...
Oh! %PLAYERNAME%, you caught me by surprise. I was just thinking about some movies I’ve seen recently.
What, you didn’t take me for a movie guy? Haha! Well, while the world of Pokémon is my greatest passion, I’ve been trying to explore my interests outside of research and Pokémon as well.
Self-discovery is important for personal growth in all walks of life. It can also be quite fun! I’ve learned that I really enjoy watching a film to pass the time now and again.
Also, a lot of movies feature Pokémon! Don’t you love it when your interests overlap?
I saw an incredibly thrilling action movie the other day. It was about a fighter who, against all odds, becomes a professional boxer alongside his trusty Machop.
Life had him on the ropes, but he just kept punching back! Talk about inspiring.
Did you know that Machop love to work out and build their muscles? They’re never satisfied, even when they train hard all day long! I wish I had that energy when I do fieldwork!
Speaking of Machop: Did you notice that more of them are appearing in the wild? That’s what reminded me of that movie in the first place!
Could you head out and learn more about Machop?
Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! Great job catching all those Machop. I wonder if you’ll grow as close as the two characters in that movie.
The main character started in a pretty tough place, but his Machop kept him motivated and inspired.
Then, he was given an incredible opportunity to compete against other fighters. My favorite part was when his Machop evolved into Machoke!
Isn’t the relationship between a Trainer and their Pokémon wonderful? Machoke are truly remarkable Pokémon, too.
A Machoke’s muscular body is so powerful, the Pokémon must wear a power-save belt to regulate its motions.
As it happens, you should have enough Machop Candies now to evolve Machop into a Machoke of your own. It’s almost like you’re living out that movie yourself!
Wow—that’s one muscular Machoke! Great work evolving it.
Sometimes, Machoke will head to fields and mountains to exercise and train. Isn’t that dedication amazing?
It reminds me of a training montage in that film. The Trainer and his Machoke traveled to the mountains to train together.
Watching their friendship blossom almost moved me to tears! The way they encouraged each other reminded me why I love Pokémon, especially when the Machoke evolved into Machamp!
Oops, there I go again… Anyway, Machop and Machoke are very impressive Pokémon, but Machamp is on an entirely different level.
Its four arms react more quickly than it can think, so Machamp can execute several punches at once!
Hoo-hah! That was the movie Machamp’s signature move. Haha, who knew I’d become such a film buff? Get it? Buff?
Moving right along…
How about you do a bit of research on Machamp? Your Machoke seems pumped to get stronger. Let’s try evolving it into Machamp and see what happens!
Wow, %PLAYERNAME%! I saw you approaching with your newly evolved Machamp, and I almost couldn’t believe my eyes. It was just like the end of that movie!
The Trainer ended up winning the tournament, and he couldn’t have done it without his Machamp by his side.
Movies are so powerful! Especially ones about Pokémon and their Trainers.
I suppose you and Machamp don’t need to watch that particular film, though—you practically lived it today! It’s been inspiring to witness, and I hope to carry that inspiration with me as I grow closer to my own Pokémon.
You never know what you’ll discover about yourself when you try new things—just like how you never know which Pokémon you’ll end up forming a lifelong friendship with until you catch them!
Thanks for coming along with me on this journey, Trainer. I wish you and your Machamp well, and I’ll see you next time. Let’s GO!
Good to see you, %PLAYERNAME%! Do you hear that sound?
All morning, I’ve been hearing the distinct sound of splashing water. While somewhat relaxing, it’s definitely not a normal thing to hear around the lab.
Upon further investigation, I noticed an increased number of Magikarp in the wild. It was quite the sight to see so many of them splashing about.
Guess it’s time to GO fishing! Get it? Because Magikarp is the Fish Pokémon?
Anyway, I think it’ll be safe to approach Magikarp, as documentation indicates they’re harmless.
However, I see potential in this Pokémon. It’s time to head out and investigate.
Great work, Trainer! While you were out, I did a bit of a refresher on Magikarp.
Did you know that some Magikarp can jump so high, they can leap over a mountain? Now that’s something I’d like to see!
Also, while having a reputation for being worthless, this hardy Pokémon can thrive in any body of water, regardless of how dirty or polluted the water might be.
I think Magikarp deserves a bit more credit, don’t you think? Let’s focus on evolving Magikarp, since doing so takes some effort.
Maybe you should try using Pinap Berries when trying to catch Magikarp. Not only are Pinap Berries tasty, but they’re quite useful as well!
Good job, %PLAYERNAME%. Thanks to the research you’ve completed, it’s time to evolve that Magikarp of yours!
Remember when I said that Magikarp is harmless? Well, that isn’t the case with its evolved form, Gyarados.
Known as the Atrocious Pokémon, Gyarados has a reputation for being destructive. Tales of its rampaging nature are consistent across all research materials we have on it.
So much for being harmless, am I right? Of note, Gyarados is both Water- and Flying-type—something you might not expect from its humble beginnings.
Looks like you’ll be adding a powerful Pokémon to your team, but let’s proceed with caution.
Wonderful work, %PLAYERNAME%. Looks like all your efforts have paid off, and you’ve got yourself a Gyarados.
I’m sure this Pokémon will be a great member of your team when battling other Trainers or even Team GO Rocket!
Even though Gyarados is known for being vicious and extremely aggressive, a talented Trainer such as yourself will be able to befriend and train it so it can meet its full potential.
I’m excited to see what kinds of challenges you’ll demolish together!
Just make sure that the demolition is limited to battles—not entire cities.
Anyway, until next time!
Ah, %PLAYERNAME%! Perfect timing. I’ve just encountered something strange!
I’ve been feeling a bit warm lately, so I walked to a nearby clearing to enjoy the cool breeze—but the temperature seemed to rise as I arrived!
Curious, isn’t it? I suspect it’s the work of a certain Pokémon.
There’s one that’s known to dislike cold areas so much, it’ll blow scorching flames to heat up its surroundings.
I believe there are large groups of this particular Pokémon appearing all over the place right now.
Ah, you’re wondering which Pokémon I’m talking about? I think I’ll keep that to myself for now. But here—I'll write it on this piece of paper, and we can check later to see if I was right!
Can you go investigate and let me know what you find? Thanks, Trainer!
Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%.
As promised, I’ll now reveal my guess as to which Pokémon is responsible for these recent temperature spikes. As you can see, I wrote down...Magmar!
My intuition is pretty “lit,” eh? Am I using that ri—AH! Wow, that little fireball turned my paper straight to ash!
Anyway, it seems the cause of these irregular warm fronts is indeed Magmar, the Spitfire Pokémon.
When it breathes deeply, heat waves form around its body, making it hard to see clearly. Isn’t that just incredible?
And to think that this intimidating Pokémon evolves from the adorable Magby, the Live Coal Pokémon!
As adorable as Magby is, though, field studies have shown that whenever it inhales and exhales, hot embers dribble out of its mouth and nostrils. Still doesn’t stop me from trying to hug it!
Anyway, %PLAYERNAME%, you should try evolving your Magmar! Check in with me again before you do, though—I’ll have more hot tips for you then.
You’re almost there, %PLAYERNAME%!
Soon, you’ll have yourself a Magmortar, the Blast Pokémon. Exciting stuff!
Watch out for the ends of its arms, though—they can produce fireballs as hot as 3,600 degrees Fahrenheit! Yowch!
Can you imagine if you could blast fireballs out of your arms? Fwoosh! Fwoosh! Hahaha! Hey, that’s pretty fun! Fwoosh!
There I go getting fired up about Pokémon again. Get it? “Fired up”? Haha, my hot streak continues!
Anyway, with this Sinnoh Stone and the Magmar Candy you’ve acquired, you should be able to evolve your Magmar into Magmortar pretty soon—so keep up the great work, %PLAYERNAME%!
Excellent work, %PLAYERNAME%! Looks like you’ve got your very own Magmortar.
Magmortar, like Magby and Magmar, tends to live in volcanos.
Its body can even take on a whitish hue from the intense heat generated by the fireballs it shoots from the ends of its arms!
Wow, learning about Magmar and its Evolutionary line has really lit a fire in my heart. I need to get back to my research, pronto!
See you around, %PLAYERNAME%!
Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! I think I’ve got an exciting adventure for you. I’ve been working on something...BIG.
Recently, we observed a large number of Weedle appearing in the wild. I wanted to investigate that phenomenon further.
After a day of research, I saw something sparkling in the tall grass near where the Weedle were gathering.
It turned out to be a smooth, stonelike object with a symbol etched into it. It glowed with an energy I’ve never encountered before!
I’d seen that symbol before in documents about Mega Evolution that I received from my colleague in Kalos, Professor Sycamore. That led me to believe that the object was somehow related.
After digging further into the documents, I theorized that Pokémon can Mega Evolve using the energy from the object I found, which I named Mega Energy.
It also occurred to me that the object I found might be related to Weedle.
Now that I’ve caught you up on my BIG discovery, let’s get started on some research. We’ll need a Weedle—I think that Pokémon has mega potential!
Great work, %PLAYERNAME%! Let’s document our findings for other Trainers.
Now, Weedle can’t Mega Evolve, but its final Evolution, Beedrill, can.
My theory is that there is Mega Energy for different Pokémon and that each Pokémon needs a certain amount of Mega Energy to Mega Evolve.
It also seems that Mega-Evolved Pokémon return to normal once their Mega Energy is depleted.
It may be difficult to gather the Mega Energy needed to Mega Evolve a Pokémon for the first time. However, it seems that once a Pokémon has Mega Evolved, it requires less Mega Energy to do so again.
Maybe it’s because Mega Evolution strengthens a Trainer’s bond with their Pokémon.
Let’s continue this investigation. How about you evolve your Weedle to its final Evolution and see whether you can find enough Mega Energy to Mega Evolve your new Beedrill.
Again, you never cease to amaze me, %PLAYERNAME%. I think you and Beedrill are going to be great partners.
I’ve learned that some other Pokémon can Mega Evolve, too.
While I’ve been able to confirm only a few, I’m sure we’ll discover more in time. At this point, you should be able to Mega Evolve your Beedrill, if you’re ready.
Now, I’m sure you are going to ask, “Professor Willow, how do I get Mega Energy for other Pokémon?”
Well, don’t worry, Trainer. Mega Venusaur, Mega Charizard, and Mega Blastoise are appearing in Mega Raids all around the world. It appears you can get Mega Energy by challenging those Mega-Evolved Pokémon.
Why don’t you Mega Evolve your Beedrill and battle with it in Mega Raids? There seem to be benefits to battling in raids alongside Mega-Evolved Pokémon for both you and your fellow Trainers.
I’m curious to see what effect Mega-Evolved Pokémon have on other Pokémon when they battle together. Why don’t you give it a try!
I dare say, this was a successful research project! It looks like you were able to acquire some Mega Energy by battling those Mega-Evolved Pokémon.
I’ve documented that you and your Mega-Evolved Pokémon can do many other things together, too.
I hope to see you and your Mega-Evolved Pokémon battling at Gyms, challenging other Trainers, combating Team GO Rocket, and, of course, taking some snapshots to send back to yours truly.
Mega-Evolved Pokémon are extremely powerful, so I think it’s best that we don’t bring our new friends into the GO Battle League just yet, at least until more research is done.
I wanted to give you a token of my appreciation for all your hard work on this project—a Mega Bracelet!
In other regions, Trainers use Mega Bracelets to help their Pokémon Mega Evolve. Based on my research into Mega Energy, it seems you won’t need a Mega Bracelet to Mega Evolve your Pokémon.
However, I thought a Mega Bracelet would be a trendy way to show off your Mega Evolution skills.
You can check it out when you want to change up your look. I hope you accept this gift with my sincerest thanks for a job well done.
Until next time, let’s GO!
%PLAYERNAME%, it’s always great to see you! I’m sure you know this, but your help in progressing my research has been essential to major breakthroughs in my work.
That’s why I’ve come to talk to you again. You probably already know what I’ll be asking!
I need your assistance in learning more about the newly discovered Pokémon that has really sent me and other Pokémon researchers into quite a tizzy.
Can you believe an undiscovered Pokémon just appeared out of the blue? You can imagine how everyone is talking about it!
I was checking a nearby habitat when I ran into a nest of them, and I was so excited, I dropped my camera! Don’t worry, though... I’m sure the repairs won’t cost me too much at the shop...
Although each Pokémon turned out to be a Ditto using the move Transform, that didn’t put a damper on my day!
So many Ditto taking on this unique Pokémon form must mean that the real Pokémon is truly out there, just waiting to be found.
Let’s get to work, %PLAYERNAME%! I know we don’t have much to go on, but I’m confident your hard work can only bring us good fortune!
But first, let me recalibrate my instruments for your area. Could you please complete the following tasks?{0}{1}{2}
Thanks, %PLAYERNAME%! I think that will be enough to help me properly conduct calculations based on the data you’ll gather in the field.
While you were out, I scanned some academic journals to see if any of my fellow researchers have encountered a Pokémon matching the description of the species I saw, but I didn’t have much luck.
But I do have a hunch! Given that this Pokémon has been unseen until just recently, I think it’s safe to say that we’re tracking another Mythical Pokémon, like Mew and Celebi.
If I’m right and this elusive Pokémon is a Mythical Pokémon, we should be able to draw it out by creating specific conditions under which it thrives.
But let’s step back for a minute, before we take a step forward. Or many steps forward, in this case! Great fieldwork starts with a walk. Could you complete a few tasks for me?
Also, remind me to contact my mentor, Professor Oak. I’m certain his brilliant mind will have something to lend to all this...
Please complete the following tasks.{0}{1}{2}
%PLAYERNAME%, I gave Professor Oak a call, and he pulled through! He says that the Pokémon is called Meltan! I think the name has a nice ring to it—don’t you?
Professor Oak got this information through an ancient text found in his archives, which included the appearance of Meltan.
What luck! Did you know that when Professor Oak was my instructor, he was my role model? And he still is!
He and I are of the same opinion that Meltan is a Mythical Pokémon, so I really think we’re on to something!
Still, a name alone isn’t going to get us very far... Perhaps the Ditto know something we don’t?
I think that if we find Ditto, we’ll be able to figure out how they acquired this curious transformation, and maybe that will lead us to Meltan.
Observation will be the best way forward, so let’s roll up our sleeves and get to work!
Please complete the following tasks.{0}{1}{2}
Excellent work, %PLAYERNAME%! The Ditto you’ve helped me analyze indeed has transformed into Meltan before. In fact, it was able to use Transform and let me analyze Meltan up close!
This Ditto was very helpful, even though it couldn’t replicate some of the finer details. It seems the memory of Meltan is fading away...
But I have good news! I was able to tell that Meltan has a liquid-metal body with a nutlike head and a tail that looks like a power cord. Judging from the appearance, it may be an Electric- or Steel-type Pokémon.
In order to make more progress, I think we should study these types of Pokémon! Can you complete the following tasks?{0}{1}{2}
Great news, %PLAYERNAME%! Thanks to all the data you’ve collected, I was able to make a detailed study of the differences between Electric-type Pokémon and Steel-type Pokémon.
Thankfully, the Ditto was able to use Transform one more time! It took me some time to figure out it was attracted to all my metal equipment.
Then I realized that it was copying every aspect of Meltan, including its behavioral patterns. Given the Ditto’s behavior, I believe Meltan is capable of assimilating metal by melting metal objects. What an interesting ability!
I can now say that, according to my research, Meltan is a Steel-type Pokémon!
I think our next step is to study more Pokémon that have similar characteristics. Can you complete the following tasks to learn more about Pokémon with fluid body surfaces or stomach acid strong enough to melt metals?
{0}{1}{2}
Oh, and one more thing—Professor Oak is also studying a Ditto in his own lab that is able to Transform into Meltan. With our parallel research, I think we’ll be able to make some breakthroughs soon!
By the time you complete all the research tasks, I should be able to circle back to you with the latest development.
Just in the nick of time, %PLAYERNAME%! With careful study of the Ditto that I sent him and the small amount of documented Meltan encounters, Professor Oak was able to solve more mysteries related to this Pokémon.
Meltan very well may have split from a Pokémon named Melmetal, which has been recorded even less than Meltan. Never before have we seen a Mythical Pokémon that can divide into multiple, independent Pokémon!
This explains why the world saw a simultaneous appearance of so many Ditto disguised as Meltan.
Professor Oak and I have made a guess as to how Meltan can re-form back into Melmetal—because Meltan have bodies similar to molten metal, they have a unique ability to merge and trigger an Evolution into Melmetal!
Do you know what Pokémon we should research next? You’re bright, %PLAYERNAME%, so I know you know the answer! I need you to collect data on Pokémon for which several parts can come together and act as one.
Can you complete the following tasks?{0}{1}{2}
Wow, I’m impressed! %PLAYERNAME%! Your data has arrived just as I’ve finished putting pieces of evidence together to learn Melmetal’s place in history.
According to these records, Melmetal was once regarded as a sacred being in a secluded community deep inside a wooded land that was rich with magnetite-bearing sedimentary rock.
People there developed ways to make unique tools out of metal shed by Melmetal. Without such metal, they couldn’t have made these tools back then.
We need to find out more about Pokémon that wield tools. Could you complete the following research tasks?{0}{1}{2}
I just received an important piece of news, %PLAYERNAME%! Remember the ancient text? It seems that a mysterious box was also excavated from the same site where the ancient text was found.
There was nothing in the box except a rusty lump of metal that bears interesting similarities to Meltan.
Perhaps exposing the box to this vast natural environment could cause something enigmatic to happen, resulting in Meltan changing states as well.
Exposing this metal to the open air could have had an entirely different effect on what’s inside the box, but we won’t know until we try it.
We may be able to find a clue about the lump of metal by delving into the world of ancient Pokémon.
Please complete the following tasks.{0}{1}{2}
I was right, %PLAYERNAME%! This artifact is truly Meltan! We did it!
Of course, the reason for Meltan’s presence inside this mysterious box can only be guessed. Maybe the people who glorified and worshiped Melmetal decided to keep it safe when the Pokémon somehow split itself apart.
Doing so could have been thought of as the only way for the people to ever meet Melmetal again. That warms the heart a little, doesn’t it, %PLAYERNAME%?
Make sure you give Meltan plenty of chances to see the vast world we live in by venturing out and exploring! Who knows what will happen from here...
Enjoy exploring, %PLAYERNAME%, and I’m sure we’ll be in touch soon!
%PLAYERNAME%, how are you? It’s been a while, hasn’t it? You’ve become quite the Trainer!
I wanted to ask for your help. As you know, I study Pokémon and their habitats. I’ve learned a lot over the years, but recently, I’ve found some hints of something mysterious.
I was wondering if you would help me investigate what's going on.
You will? That’s great!
First things first, let’s calibrate my instruments to your area.
Could you please complete the following research tasks?{0}{1}{2}
Great. Thanks, %PLAYERNAME%! Now I should be able to detect anything out of the ordinary.
I believe we need to be on the lookout for a Mythical Pokémon! Mythical Pokémon are extremely rare and unique, and many consider their existence to be mere rumor.
Could you help get my equipment set up around your local habitat? This’ll be a great time to take your buddy out to explore a bit and hatch some Eggs!
Please complete the following research tasks.{0}{1}{2}
Incredible! This confirms my initial suspicion. I think we’re seeing evidence of Mew!
A Pokémon found in a jungle far to the south that was thought to have been extinct. It is so rare that many experts say that it is a myth. %BREAK%Only a few people have seen it worldwide. Apparently, it appears only to those people who are pure of heart and have a strong desire to see it.
My colleagues in Kanto, including my instructor, Professor Oak, spent a long time studying Mew. It looks like our findings match theirs!
According to our research, Mew was said to be observed using moves of all kinds. This observation has led some of us to say that Mew is the ancestor of all Pokémon!
Perhaps by studying Pokémon in battle, we’ll learn more!
Please perform the following research tasks.{0}{1}{2}
Great work, %PLAYERNAME%! This will help point us in the right direction.
Did you know Mew is said to hold the genetic codes of all Pokémon? Mew’s secrets could be a link to understanding the mystery of Pokémon growth and Evolution!
Let's study some Pokémon Evolution to learn more about Mew!
Please perform these research tasks for me.{0}{1}{2}
Amazing. Just amazing! Isn’t Evolution wondrous? I learn something new every time I see it!
With the data we’ve collected so far, I should be able to pinpoint Mew’s location! It looks like...
Yes, it looks like Mew has visited your area recently! Hmm... Interesting. If that's the case, someone should have reported a sighting...
Maybe Mew is hiding or disguised as another Pokémon? Let's study some other Pokémon that use these tricks and the best ways to catch them!
Please perform the following research tasks.{0}{1}{2}
Thank you, %PLAYERNAME%! With your help, I’ve determined that Mew is invisible!
Let's collect some data to build a tool to find it. I have an idea... I’ll need you to study some powerful Pokémon up close to help me out!
Could you complete the following research tasks?{0}{1}{2}
Nice! My prototype is functioning well. I’ve upgraded your AR camera with the new ability to see invisible Pokémon!
The final step is to lure out Mew. Mew is said only to appear to those who are pure of heart and have a strong desire to meet it...
Let’s show Mew what a great Trainer you are and how excited we are to see it!
Please carry out the following research tasks.{0}{1}{2}
We found Mew! Awesome! This is an experience to remember forever.
Now you can see why I love studying Pokémon so much! The whole world is out there to discover. So go have some fun!
My assistants and I will request some Special Research from you in the future. Stay in touch!
Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! It’s great to see you again! I’m always grateful to have a helping hand with my research.
Speaking of research, have you heard of Porygon, the Virtual Pokémon?
Well, I’m not entirely sure why, but Porygon have been appearing more frequently in the area as of late!
I’d like to take this opportunity to learn more about this odd Pokémon. How about it, Trainer? Will you go out and catch some Porygon for me?
Fantastic work, %PLAYERNAME%!
I was able to review the data you collected, and I discovered that Porygon is made entirely of programming code!
Other reports I dug up mention that it was created by a group of scientists using state-of-the-art technology. Can you believe it? A man-made Pokémon!
Porygon have made a name for themselves by protecting cyberspace from suspicious activity! For something artificial, they sure do seem caring.
Maybe I should keep a Porygon around in case Team GO Rocket tries a digital take-over...
Well, in the meantime, I’d like to learn more about Porygon’s evolved form, Porygon2.
I have a hunch that you’ll need to use an Upgrade to evolve Porygon. Let's get back out there and see if we can't find one!
Excellent work, %PLAYERNAME%!
Thanks to your efforts, I’ve realized just how different Porygon2 is from Porygon.
According to my findings, further research and the implementation of artificial intelligence into its code allowed Porygon2 to develop the ability to learn independent of its programming.
The power of science is just astounding, isn’t it?
These reports also mention that Porygon2 was upgraded to enable extraterrestrial exploration and planetary development, though it has yet to accomplish much.
I wonder what this means for Porygon’s final Evolution, Porygon-Z?
For your next batch of research, I want you to evolve Porygon2 into Porygon-Z using a Sinnoh Stone. Good luck out there, Trainer!
Congrats on evolving your Porygon2 into a Porygon-Z, %PLAYERNAME%!
I’ve uncovered some notes about this Pokémon that I thought you’d find interesting.
According to reports, an update was added to Porygon-Z’s programming that was supposed to allow it to move between dimensions. But the upgrade also caused Porygon-Z to become unstable, and it began behaving erratically.
Because the update caused instability, academics can’t seem to agree on whether Porygon-Z should be considered a true Evolution of Porygon2.
It’s going to take a bit of time to file away all this research, but I’m thrilled we were able to learn more about Porygon and its Evolutions!
Your hard work is always appreciated, %PLAYERNAME%, and I’ll be in touch as soon as I’m in need of another inquisitive eye!
Until then, let’s GO!
Hi, %PLAYERNAME%, I’m glad to see you! Can I get your help with investigating something?
I’ve noticed an alarming number of reports from Trainers who have found PokéStops that look...discolored?
Some Trainers have even spotted people wearing shirts with a big letter R on them who are guarding these PokéStops.
These shady characters appear to have Pokémon with a mysterious dark aura around them!
As I investigate this with Spark, it might be best to power up some of your Pokémon. You never know what we might encounter...
Great job strengthening your Pokémon!
After visiting one of the PokéStops with Spark, we were challenged to a Trainer Battle by someone who belongs to an organization called Team GO Rocket!
Turns out that Team GO Rocket has been stealing resources from PokéStops with the help of Pokémon that are cloaked in a dark aura. They’re called Shadow Pokémon!
Luckily, we won the battle, and afterward, Team GO Rocket carelessly abandoned their defeated Shadow Pokémon!
Help us protect local PokéStops from Team GO Rocket, Trainer! As you do so, please save any Shadow Pokémon that Team GO Rocket abandons!
Thanks for all your hard work, %PLAYERNAME%! Candela and I have done some research on Shadow Pokémon and learned some very unsettling things.
While Pokémon naturally become stronger through training, these Shadow Pokémon seem to have been overpowered through unnatural means.
As a result, their bodies painfully struggle with not knowing how to control this strength.
But don’t worry! It looks like we can help them harness this strength through a process called purification.
Can you help me purify some Shadow Pokémon, %PLAYERNAME%?
WOW! Thanks for helping us learn more about the Shadow Pokémon that Team GO Rocket uses, Trainer!
After observing the purification process with Blanche, it’s clear that the Pokémon’s gratefulness to you for purifying them causes the move Frustration to be replaced with Return!
Now that you have this knowledge, we need your help with saving as many Shadow Pokémon as possible by taking back PokéStops that are under Team GO Rocket’s control!
The world is under attack! Can we count on you to help protect it? I do hope there’s nothing more to this...
Thanks for your help in defeating Team GO Rocket Grunts, %PLAYERNAME%!
The team leaders and I have been observing Team GO Rocket, and something tells us this is far from over.
The transmission sent during the Team GO Rocket take-over had a message from an unknown sender at the end.
We’re going to need all the help we can get to reveal the identity of this unknown figure looming in the shadows, and you are just the Trainer for the job!
Can you help us get to the bottom of this mystery?
Thank you for your continued support against those pesky Team GO Rocket Grunts.
As they flee, some Grunts are leaving behind Mysterious Components.
I believe these are what Team GO Rocket is using to hack and steal resources from PokéStops. Clever little devices, aren’t they?
There’s information we can glean from these components that will help us in our fight against this dangerous organization.
Once you have enough pieces, you should be able to assemble something similar to the device I’ve modified in my lab. It might be best to prepare yourself for whatever might come, %PLAYERNAME%.
Interesting. It appears there’s more to Team GO Rocket than previously thought.
Their ingenuity has got me thinking there might be another use for these Mysterious Components. We shouldn’t underestimate Team GO Rocket.
It’s time to get battle ready, %PLAYERNAME%.
I don’t want to send you out to face another foe without some more training.
While you sharpen your battle skills, I’ll be sure to get this little project of mine up and operational.
Fantastic work, Trainer. I’ve been working on a prototype for something I call the Rocket Radar, but I was missing some critical components.
Your hard work in retrieving these components actually made my device work!
If we combine my research and these Mysterious Components you’ve found, we can create a radar-like tool to track down Team GO Rocket Hideouts!
Trainers all over the world are figuring out how to put together devices like this, and they’re identifying more hideouts than I originally anticipated.
%PLAYERNAME%, it’s time to head to these hideouts and face whatever—or whomever—is there head on. Let’s GO.
You battled well, %PLAYERNAME%! You’ve done your team leaders—and me—proud.
According to my observations, it appears the sender of that mysterious transmission during the Team GO Rocket take-over was not in attendance.
There’s someone else calling the shots—someone above Sierra, Cliff, and Arlo.
I’ve improved on my previous invention and put together a Super Rocket Radar that should help you track this mastermind down.
If it is who I think it is, he signs all his messages with “G.”
Astounding work, %PLAYERNAME%!
You’ve put a stop to Team GO Rocket’s plans for the time being and rescued a special Shadow Pokémon!
It’s unlikely that Giovanni will give up this easily, so I hope we can rely on you to take down Team GO Rocket members as they appear around your area.
Spark, Blanche, and Candela will be on the lookout as well.
I’m sure Team GO Rocket will try to hatch another villainous plot soon...
Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%. Thanks for your help holding back Team GO Rocket’s forces. It’s good to know I can rely on you.
However, something tells me Team GO Rocket won’t be going away anytime soon, so we’re in it for the long haul.
We need to think long-term about our strategy when it comes to Team GO Rocket.
I want to make sure only the most-prepared Trainers are equipped with Super Rocket Radar devices to track Giovanni.
I know you’re an accomplished Trainer, but let’s make sure your skills are keeping up with the challenge Team GO Rocket poses.
Astounding work, %PLAYERNAME%!
You know how purifying Shadow Pokémon makes them stronger afterward due to the gratitude they feel toward you for saving them?
Maybe one of the Pokémon you purify will become a trusted partner in our efforts to fight against Team GO Rocket’s invasion.
We need to continue saving and purifying these Pokémon.
Remember this: a good Trainer is strong, but a great Trainer is caring and kind.
Fantastic! Good work purifying all those Pokémon, %PLAYERNAME%. They’re practically glowing with gratitude!
It’s easy to tell Shadow and Purified Pokémon apart by the auras that surround them.
One of my favorite sights is a Purified Pokémon standing proud atop a Gym controlled by its Trainer’s team. It’s truly a thing to behold.
It’s time for you and your new friends to train alongside one another.
A difficult challenge awaits you, so you need to be prepared for battle, %PLAYERNAME%.
You should feel proud of your progress, %PLAYERNAME%.
The team leaders and I are certainly proud of how much you’ve grown as a Trainer.
I have one final task for you before I can be sure your skills are keeping up with an opponent like Giovanni.
If you can show me that you can still defeat the Team GO Rocket Leaders...
then I’ll know that you and your Pokémon are in top form.
Your skills are as impressive as ever. It’s time for you to take a Super Rocket Radar and see if you can track down the boss himself.
%PLAYERNAME%, I think you’re ready to take on Giovanni again.
You’ve proven your strength in battle, and you’ve also shown your compassion by saving and purifying Shadow Pokémon.
So get out there and confront Giovanni. With loyal Pokémon at your side and lots of experience under your belt, you’re unstoppable!
Good luck, %PLAYERNAME%!
Fantastic work, %PLAYERNAME%! You should enjoy your victory, of course, but it looks like our work isn’t done.
While you were busy, I was doing some reconnaissance. I have to admit, it’s been quite thrilling!
As you might have guessed, there are many more hideouts and headquarters out there that the Team GO Rocket Leaders and Giovanni could be hiding in.
We may have defeated them for the moment, but I’m sure they’ll be back and causing more trouble soon.
When that day comes, be sure you’re ready for the challenge!
Good to see you again, %PLAYERNAME%.
I’m sure you’ve seen that Team GO Rocket has continued their plans to take over PokéStops and turn even more Pokémon into Shadow Pokémon.
Have you seen an increase in Team GO Rocket activity in your area?
The team leaders and I have been getting reports from Trainers all over the world that these villains haven’t given up.
We need to keep working to save Pokémon from these no-good Grunts and their leaders.
Incredible work, %PLAYERNAME%.
Persistence and determination are key in our continued efforts to take down Team GO Rocket!
Please keep it up.
It’s time to purify more Shadow Pokémon.
They have you to thank for saving them! Perhaps one of the Pokémon you saved will become an essential member of your battle team.
How has your training been going, %PLAYERNAME%?
Be sure to build a healthy habit of improving yourself!
Training isn’t a one-and-done thing.
Becoming a great Trainer is something that comes with continued practice.
It’s important that you’re prepared for the challenges ahead, so let’s GO!
All right! You make the team leaders—and me—proud, %PLAYERNAME%.
It’s time to head out and show those Team GO Rocket Leaders that we’re strong enough to hold our own.
We can’t let these bullies get in our way when we’re saving Pokémon!
Fantastic work. Have you noticed, %PLAYERNAME%?
There seems to be a trend behind which Pokémon Giovanni is turning into Shadow Pokémon. I’m thinking about the fact that he has Legendary Shadow Pokémon.
Could that have anything to do with why he’s here?
In any case, the time has come to track him down.
The more we battle Giovanni and his team of Grunts, the more we learn about why he’s waging these take-overs.
You’ve shown what it takes to be a true Trainer, %PLAYERNAME%.
Your battle with Giovanni wasn’t easy, but the skills you’ve learned through practice and patience have paid off.
Keep your eyes open, Trainer.
Giovanni does not like to lose, so I’m sure he’ll be back soon, trying to further his plans.
I’m sure I can count on you when he returns.
Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%. Thanks for your help battling Team GO Rocket. Trainers like you help keep Pokémon safe!
But this battle is far from over, and we must continue learning about Team GO Rocket, their leaders, and their boss, Giovanni.
Looks like the Rocket Radar I developed is helping the cause. I remember when this strange activity started happening...
Back then, I had a hunch the Mysterious Components that Team GO Rocket Grunts were leaving behind held more secrets than we originally thought. We’ve come quite a long way since then!
On that note, could you continue your work battling Grunts and helping Shadow Pokémon?
Wonderful work, %PLAYERNAME%.
I remember the first time we came across Shadow Pokémon. It was heartbreaking to see the pain they were in, and I knew I had to do something.
As a Pokémon Professor, I always want to contribute and help where I can. I may not be an accomplished battler like you, %PLAYERNAME%, but I can use my skills as a researcher and scientist to assist you on your journey.
That was why I started using Mysterious Components to build the prototype for the Rocket Radar. I hoped that Trainers like you could use it in our ongoing fight against Team GO Rocket and in our efforts to rescue more Pokémon.
So let’s get out there and do just that. I’m grateful for your help, especially now. It’s when times are toughest that we have the greatest opportunity to shine!
Thank you for purifying those Pokémon, %PLAYERNAME%. I’m sure they are just as grateful as I am for your dedication.
Rescuing these Pokémon was the main reason for my work on the Rocket Radar prototype.
Luckily, with the help of the team leaders and motivated Trainers like you, we were able to develop a functioning Rocket Radar and even start work on the Super Rocket Radar!
While a terrible situation, the Team GO Rocket invasion has been a thrilling adventure and research opportunity. I’m anxious but excited to send our findings over to my mentor, Professor Oak. I’ll be sure to let him know you said hello!
Now, it’s time to get back to work. Let’s test your battle skills, %PLAYERNAME%!
I’m always so impressed when Trainers use supereffective moves in battle. It’s a sign of greatness when you see a Trainer using type effectiveness to their advantage.
All our work lately seems to have gotten Team GO Rocket’s attention.
Reports are coming in that Sierra, Cliff, and Arlo are currently lurking in the area. You know what to do, %PLAYERNAME%!
I knew you could do it, %PLAYERNAME%. The more you practice, the better you’ll be able to take on those pesky Team GO Rocket Leaders. I’m sure they’re already scheming up their next plan after this defeat.
But now, Giovanni is waiting.
Using the Super Rocket Radar, track him down and defeat him. We must remain strong—Giovanni is relentless. I wonder why he continues his invasion...
There are so many resources and Pokémon in our world. His evil plans must have something to do with that. My research will continue, but we need you to face him.
Good luck, %PLAYERNAME%. We’re counting on you.
Fantastic work, %PLAYERNAME%!
I will definitely be adding your victory as a note to the research I send over to Professor Oak.
I’m sure he will be interested in anything you’ve learned about Shadow Pokémon and the continuing Team GO Rocket invasion, so please keep up your research and send it my way.
It may seem small, but every little bit helps!
I’ll be in touch soon, since we know Team GO Rocket isn’t likely to go anywhere. I know you’ll be ready for whatever happens next!
Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%. You’ve been instrumental in keeping back Team GO Rocket’s forces.
Thanks to your hard work, we’ve learned so much about this enemy.
Team GO Rocket won’t be going away anytime soon, so I’m glad I can rely on you and your fellow Trainers.
While you’ve done an amazing job so far, I’m looking for more opportunities for you to hone your skills. Every good Trainer needs to stay on their toes!
The Super Rocket Radar is in good hands with you on the task, but I wouldn’t be a good Professor if I didn’t make sure you were keeping up with Giovanni.
As expected, %PLAYERNAME%. Fantastic work!
Even though we’ve been fighting off the threat of Team GO Rocket for some time, I’m still concerned about the fact that Shadow Pokémon keep appearing.
It seems even more Pokémon are being turned into Shadow Pokémon despite our efforts. I’ve been tracking this situation, and the numbers have almost tripled since all this began.
We need to keep pushing forward—those Pokémon need our help! Can I rely on you to purify more Shadow Pokémon?
I’m sure you’ll see them shine with gratitude once you do!
Thank you for your efforts, %PLAYERNAME%.
I’m getting more and more concerned about the growing number of Shadow Pokémon, so we need to keep fighting back against this threat.
Your talent has made it clear that you’re ready for the next step in your preparations.
Use your battle skills to take on some Grunts. I think with some further observation, I can figure out what you need to do to make sure you’re at your best!
All right! You should feel proud of your progress, %PLAYERNAME%. You consistently impress me and the team leaders.
Candela could learn a thing or two from your battle prowess. I’m sure the Team GO Rocket Leaders see you as a challenge.
Take that challenge to them, and drive them out of wherever they’re holed up!
%PLAYERNAME%, your preparations are complete—you’re ready to take on Giovanni.
It’s time for you to use the Super Rocket Radar to track down the boss himself.
You’ve proven not only your strength in battle but also your compassion through saving and purifying Shadow Pokémon.
Confront Giovanni with that strength and compassion, and I believe he won’t be able to stop you!
Good luck, %PLAYERNAME%!
Well done, %PLAYERNAME%. You’ve shown Team GO Rocket just how strong your training has made you.
Although your battle with Giovanni wasn’t easy, the skills you’ve learned through practice and patience have paid off.
But keep your wits about you, %PLAYERNAME%.
Giovanni doesn’t like to lose, so I’m sure he’ll be back soon to further his plans.
I know I can count on you when he returns, but until then, I’ll work on finding some training opportunities for you so you can keep developing your skills.
Great to see you again, %PLAYERNAME%. You’ve done such an amazing job with every challenge I’ve given you.
Congrats on coming so far as a Trainer! You constantly impress me with your skills.
But there are so many aspects to Pokémon training! I think it’s time to switch things up. I spoke with Spark, and he thought it would be good for you to focus some more on taking care of Pokémon Eggs.
Why not take a walk with your buddy Pokémon after placing some Eggs into Incubators?
And be sure to rescue Shadow Pokémon from any Team GO Rocket members you encounter, too. Those Pokémon still need our help!
Wonderful work, %PLAYERNAME%. While you were busy, I met up with Blanche to discuss our research on recent developments with Shadow Pokémon.
I had observed that Team GO Rocket somehow seemed to be making Shadow Pokémon deal more damage with their attacks, though they also seem to take more damage in return now. My observations line up with Blanche’s research.
Both of us are concerned that despite our best efforts to push Team GO Rocket back, they’re still gaining ground and putting more and more Pokémon in danger.
While Blanche and I continue to investigate, can we depend on you to take down some more Grunts to slow Team GO Rocket down?
I’m also going to assign you some tasks to test you as a Trainer. Battling Grunts alone won’t keep your skills as sharp as they need to be to continue standing up to Team GO Rocket’s leaders.
Thanks for taking on those Grunts, %PLAYERNAME%.
I was working with Candela to figure out what challenges we could give you to help you prepare for battles with other Trainers and in the GO Battle League. Those skills carry over to doing battle with the Team GO Rocket Leaders, after all!
Candela was very excited to find ways to keep you on your toes!
Could you take on these challenges as part of your ongoing training?
You’ve done the team leaders proud, %PLAYERNAME%!
You took on those challenges like the skilled Trainer you are.
Great work. Now it’s time to continue the battle against Team GO Rocket.
Your efforts to rescue and purify Shadow Pokémon have certainly not gone unnoticed.
I’ll be sure to share any new findings about Team GO Rocket’s continued invasion as soon as they crop up, but right now, we should keep up the pressure on the Team GO Rocket Leaders. Good luck, %PLAYERNAME%.
Taking on the Team GO Rocket Leaders is no easy task. They have proven to be difficult opponents for even the most accomplished Trainers.
One interesting thing to note is that I’ve heard reports of Trainers rescuing Shiny Shadow Pokémon from the Team GO Rocket Leaders.
This only further supports my suspicions that Team GO Rocket is gathering large numbers of Pokémon if they’ve been able to find Shiny ones to turn into Shadow Pokémon.
There is definitely more that we need to learn about these foes and what their plans are.
For now, I need you to focus. It’s time to take on Giovanni himself. You got this, %PLAYERNAME%.
What an impressive victory, %PLAYERNAME%!
Giovanni is one of the toughest opponents out there, but your continued efforts to improve let you rise to the challenge! After this, I’m going to talk with the team leaders to discuss how we can further support you.
You’ve been an amazing part of the team, and we wouldn’t be able to keep these villains at bay without your skills and dedication.
But we can’t drop our guard while Team GO Rocket’s around, so keep honing your battle techniques. I suggest challenging your fellow Trainers to battles and testing yourself in the GO Battle League.
I’ll be in touch again soon, but until then, let’s GO!
Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! It’s good to see you, though I’m sorry it has to be under such dire circumstances.
What circumstances, you ask? Well, it appears as if Team GO Rocket is—you guessed it—stirring up more trouble!
We’ve just received word that they’re doing something strange at PokéStops.
What exactly they’re doing—and to what end—is what we need to figure out. Let’s get out there and see what we can find!
Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%. It looks like Grunts aren’t involved in whatever new experiments Team GO Rocket is performing.
As you might recall, Grunts use Shadow Pokémon, which are Pokémon that have been trained in unnatural and harmful ways to become incredibly powerful.
We’ve heard rumors that Arlo was the one who spearheaded the Shadow Pokémon program not long after he parted ways with Candela and Team Valor.
More recently, Spark discovered that Team GO Rocket may be hatching a plot involving Pokémon Eggs! Is Arlo involved in this, too?
Let’s investigate more PokéStops and purify some Shadow Pokémon while we’re at it. Something is bound to come up!
Great job saving and purifying those Shadow Pokémon, %PLAYERNAME%!
I noticed you caught a Larvitar. It’s highly unusual to see one in the wild. Maybe it came from one of the Pokémon Eggs that Team GO Rocket has been collecting...
While you were out battling Grunts, the team leaders and I discovered that Team GO Rocket has been collecting a mysterious kind of Pokémon Egg we’re calling Strange Eggs.
It appears that mostly Poison- or Dark-type Pokémon hatch from these Eggs. Let’s save and hatch as many Strange Eggs as possible before Team GO Rocket is able to grow their ranks!
The Team GO Rocket Leaders seem to be guarding these Strange Eggs, so let’s start by finding them. Be sure you have space for Eggs and some Incubators at the ready!
Great job defeating those leaders, %PLAYERNAME%! You’ve saved some pretty cute Pokémon in the process, if I do say so myself.
While you were off fighting Team GO Rocket, Spark and I did some more sleuthing and discovered that Sierra might actually be the brains behind the Strange Eggs!
It appears there’s more to a Team GO Rocket Leader’s duties than just taking over PokéStops and challenging Trainers to battle.
First Arlo with Shadow Pokémon, and now Sierra with these Strange Eggs... I wonder what else Team GO Rocket’s got tucked up their sleeves.
This doesn’t sit well with me, %PLAYERNAME%. Let’s track down those leaders again! We have to do all we can to disrupt their plans!
Incredible work, %PLAYERNAME%! Hopefully that’ll keep them at bay for a little while.
I managed to craft another Super Rocket Radar for you that’ll help you track down Giovanni. But be careful—according to a field report from Blanche and Candela, he’s got Shadow Mewtwo with him!
I managed to build another Super Rocket Radar to help you track down Giovanni. But be careful—Blanche and Candela’s reports revealed that Giovanni has got a Legendary Shadow Pokémon with him!
You might have encountered Shadow Mewtwo the last time Giovanni appeared. We’d thought that was the last we’d see of it, but it looks like it’s back!
You need to save it, Trainer! I have no doubt Giovanni plans on using this poor Pokémon to nefarious ends.
You need to save Shadow Mewtwo, Trainer! I have a feeling Giovanni plans on using this poor Pokémon for nefarious ends.
Celebrations are in order, %PLAYERNAME%. You’ve done it again—you’ve defeated Team GO Rocket’s Grunts, its leaders, and even Giovanni!
Not to mention all the Shadow Pokémon you saved along the way, including Shadow Mewtwo!
Not only did you stop Team GO Rocket, but you also saved several Pokémon along the way!
This is probably not the last that we’ll see of Giovanni or Team GO Rocket, but that also means there’ll likely be more Strange Eggs to collect and Shadow Pokémon to save! Let’s get cracking, Trainer!
Good to see you, %PLAYERNAME%. I’m sorry to call you here so suddenly, but I’m afraid there’s trouble afoot.
That’s right—Team GO Rocket is up to no good! We’re not sure what their plan is just yet, but we know we have to stop them.
Now, let’s GO!
Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%. You did a tremendous job defeating those Team GO Rocket Grunts and saving those poor Shadow Pokémon!
While you were busy battling, I received reports that Team GO Rocket has obtained a Flying-type Legendary Pokémon.
Blanche is doing recon as we speak in hopes of figuring out exactly which Legendary Pokémon we’re dealing with. I have no doubt we’ll have more information soon.
While we wait, why don’t you conduct some research on Flying-type Pokémon?
Thanks for catching all those Flying-type Pokémon, %PLAYERNAME%!
Blanche and I have been analyzing them to help us learn more about the Legendary Pokémon that Team GO Rocket captured.
Unfortunately, our current hypothesis points to this Pokémon being one that’s near and dear to the team leaders’ hearts.
While we gather more information, could you head back out into the field? We can’t let Team GO Rocket continue its plan unopposed!
Welcome back, Trainer. I see you’ve got yourself a Pidgeot and some Pidgeot Mega Energy!
As impressive as this Pokémon is, though, it doesn’t seem to be the Flying-type Pokémon we've heard about in our reports.
Blanche’s latest intel points to Giovanni being the one holding on to this mysterious Flying-type Legendary Pokémon, so we need to track him down.
We believe our best bet at doing so is by first finding the Team GO Rocket Leaders—and that’s where you come in, Trainer. Let’s GO!
Great work, %PLAYERNAME%! You’ve been a huge help in our efforts to track down Giovanni. I’m happy to report that the team leaders and I have made significant headway in our investigation.
I’ve managed to finish building another Super Rocket Radar for you. You can use it to find and defeat Giovanni—and save that Legendary Pokémon!
Fantastic work as always, %PLAYERNAME%!
The fight against Team GO Rocket and their malicious machinations continues, but at least for today we can rest knowing that we’ve foiled their latest scheme.
So, until next time—let’s GO!
Ahhh... Do you smell that, Trainer?
I first caught a whiff of that curious aroma as I was out on my daily morning walk.
Upon investigation, I discovered that the scent was being produced by an uncommonly large group of Roselia that had assembled nearby.
Did you know you can judge a Roselia’s health by the strength of its aroma? Well, let me tell you—those were VERY healthy Roselia!
But while they certainly smell nice and look pretty, I advise you to take care when encountering them.
The thorns on Roselia’s head contain a vicious poison, and it can launch them at any opponent bold enough to try to steal the flowers on its arms. Every rose, as they say!
It’s unusual to see so many Roselia in one place. Would you mind assisting me in researching this phenomenon?
Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%!
While you were out in the field, I did some reading on Roselia.
When it comes to Pokémon, new discoveries are being made all the time—so it’s important to make sure your information is up to date.
Roselia, the Thorn Pokémon, evolves from Budew, the Bud Pokémon. Budew is sensitive to changes in temperature, and its bud is said to bloom when warmed by the sun.
It’s also both Grass and Poison type, much like Roselia.
In reviewing these two Pokémon, I remembered something tremendously exciting! I still need to conduct a bit more research before sharing my findings, however. Would you mind assisting me?
As aromatic Pokémon go, we’re pretty fortunate it’s Roselia appearing en masse and not, say, Muk.
A big group of Muk gathered under the sun... The whole place would smell like baked garbage!
Oh! Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%. Didn’t realize you were back.
I found that interesting bit of information I wanted to share with you.
According to my research, Roselia that drink nutritionally rich springwater are said to reveal rare coloration when they bloom.
Isn’t that fascinating? Have you seen anything like that while you’ve been out doing research?
You seem to have a lucky streak, so I wouldn’t put it past you!
Now that you’re back, I’d like you to evolve a Roselia with the Sinnoh Stone I gave you.
I’m excited to see the final Evolution in this line of Grass- and Poison-type Pokémon!
Great work, Trainer! Your Roselia has evolved into the Bouquet Pokémon, Roserade!
It moves like a dancer and strikes with whips that are densely lined with poison thorns.
Oh, and have you noticed that each of Roserade’s hands is a different color?
Each contains a different toxin. The poison in its right hand is quick acting, while the poison in its left hand is slow acting.
What an amazing Pokémon!
Thanks for all your assistance today, Trainer. Documenting situations like this is essential to learning more about the Pokémon in the world around us.
Until next time, let’s GO!
Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! It’s good to see you.
As you know, I’ve recently been conducting research on several different regions in the world of Pokémon. Along the way, I came across some books that collected stories and legends from various regions.
One of these tomes told of three Legendary Pokémon from the Unova region—a trio that seem to be capable of changing formes.
Needless to say, that piqued my interest, and I became so enveloped in my research that I even began seeing those three Legendary Pokémon in my dreams!
Which brings me to why I called you here. Can you help me with some research, Trainer? I was thinking we could start by catching some Rock-type Pokémon—you know, just to give ourselves a sturdy foundation to build from.
...Get it? Sturdy? Because they’re...Rock-type? A-anyway, I’d appreciate the help. Let’s GO!
Welcome back, Trainer. Now that we’ve established a foundation for our research, we need to narrow our focus.
There are three stories I want to investigate, so I think the best approach is to focus on one story at a time and see what we can learn.
My hope is to discover as much as we can about these Pokémon, so that when we see clues or signs of their appearance, we’re as prepared as possible!
This first story tells of a Legendary Pokémon called Landorus. The story says that lands visited by Landorus yield such bountiful crops that it’s been hailed as “The Guardian of the Fields.”
Landorus seems to have two formes: Incarnate Forme, and the very rarely seen Therian Forme. I haven’t been able to find any imagery depicting the latter, but every source I’ve read agrees on its existence!
For now, why don’t we research Ground-type Pokémon? Maybe in doing so we can better equip ourselves to identify Landorus’s Therian Forme when the time comes.
Thank you, %PLAYERNAME%. I think we’ve gained a better understanding of Landorus after studying Ground-type Pokémon.
And is that a Drilbur you’ve got there? I dig it! ...Haha! Sorry, sorry.
Anyway, since we’ve explored all our leads on Landorus for the moment, what do you say we move on to another Pokémon from my dream?
Let’s focus on Tornadus next. The texts say Tornadus expels massive energy from its tail, causing severe storms, and that its power is great enough to blow houses away.
Like Landorus, Tornadus also has both Incarnate and Therian Formes. Hmm... Maybe researching Flying-type Pokémon in the area is our best bet for now? Let’s give it a shot, Trainer!
Excellent work, Trainer! Thanks for documenting that information about Tornadus. It seems you even found yourself a darling Ducklett along the way! Is it all it’s quacked up to be? Haha!
I think we’ve learned everything we can about Tornadus for now. Its Therian Forme is still a mystery, but hopefully not for long!
Before we start investigating the final Legendary Pokémon from my dream, I need to share something...strange.
You see, I’d been running myself a bit ragged with research, so I stopped for an afternoon nap. In the resulting dream, I saw those three Unovan Legendary Pokémon again, clear as crystal. But then, the whole dream just started...fading.
It was almost like something was eating the dream itself. I’m still not sure what to make of it all, but let's stay on the lookout for anything suspicious. I have a hunch this may be the work of a Pokémon nearby.
For now, though, let’s continue our research and turn our attention to the last of the three Unovan Legendary Pokémon detailed in those stories—Thundurus.
Thundurus is known as the Bolt Strike Pokémon, and its story also references both Incarnate and Therian Formes. The spikes on its tail are said to discharge immense bolts of lightning.
For the sake of consistency, let’s go ahead and research Electric-type Pokémon in the area as we compile our notes on Thundurus.
Ah, there you are, %PLAYERNAME%. I have something big to share!
But first, I want to thank you for all your hard work collecting information on Landorus, Tornadus, and Thundurus.
I feel confident that when the time comes, you’ll be prepared to encounter any of these amazing Legendary Pokémon—regardless of which forme they appear in.
Now—do you remember that strange experience I had where my dream began fading inexplicably? I think I may have finally uncovered the cause.
While consulting the Pokédex for possible culprits, I came across an entry for a Pokémon called Munna. It’s known as the Dream Eater Pokémon—so you can see why it caught my eye!
Munna is said to eat the dreams of both people and Pokémon, expelling mist as a result. The mist is pink if the dream is pleasant, and black if it’s a nightmare.
I was pretty pleased to be dreaming of those Unovan Legendary Pokémon again, so I suspect Munna’s mist was nice and rosy that day!
Munna seems like a fascinating Pokémon, and I can’t wait to research it more. I hope you’ll give me a hand when the time comes, Trainer! Now, let’s GO!
Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! Perfect timing.
I just got back from a lengthy stroll in the sunshine. It’s incredible how much a bit of fresh air can affect your energy and mood!
But that’s not the only thing that’s got me feeling chipper. You see, I witnessed something quite interesting while I was out and about.
Perhaps in response to the abundant sunlight, a congregation of Snivy appears to have formed nearby.
I don’t know about you, but this seems to me like a golden opportunity to research the Grass Snake Pokémon. Could you lend me a hand?
They’re known to be fairly calm, so you shouldn’t have much trouble observing them.
Good luck out there!
Welcome back, Trainer! Great work.
I have some information for you on why Snivy are so fond of the sun.
These Grass-type Pokémon photosynthesize by bathing their tails in sunlight. Much like the sunshine they crave, Snivy are quite bright!
They were first encountered in the Unova region, where they were known for their intelligence and calm demeanor. Fascinating!
While we continue researching their sudden appearance, could you evolve a Snivy for me? I’d like to document its Evolution, Servine.
Take care when you do, however—Servine is known for its masterful whipping techniques.
Wonderful work, %PLAYERNAME%! That’s a mighty fine Servine.
Like Snivy, Servine is known as the Grass Snake Pokémon. It moves along the ground as if sliding. Though it’s far from sluggish, it won’t hesitate to seek out the shadows of thick foliage to avoid attacks.
Now that we’ve properly documented Snivy and Servine, I’d like to move on to Serperior, Snivy’s final Evolution.
Serperior is known as the Regal Pokémon, and much like Snivy and Servine, it also has a penchant for sunlight. It takes in solar energy and boosts it internally.
Could you evolve your Servine into Serperior for me, Trainer? It’ll be a great boon to my research, and you’ll have a powerful Grass-type Pokémon to join your journey as well!
Fantastic work, Trainer! I have no doubt Serperior will prove a potent asset on your adventures.
It has an incredible ability to stop its opponents’ movements with a single glare. Should the opponent prove bold enough to continue, Serperior will give its all in battle.
Having a Pokémon like that by your side would be pretty inspiring, I’d say!
Anyway, thanks again for all your help in this sun-soaked endeavor. I think I’ll take one more walk before the day’s done—can’t let weather like this go to waste!
Until next time, let’s GO!
Oh, %PLAYERNAME%! You’ve dropped by just in time.
As I was out on my regular walk one evening, I stumbled upon this odd stone. Something told me to bring it back to my lab for further research, and ever since then, strange things have been happening.
Papers shifting around, water glasses tipping all by themselves...
When I tried using my computer to research it, I got an error message with the number 108 flashing! %PLAYERNAME%, can you help gather some data on nearby Ghost-type Pokémon?
I have to believe we can solve these spooky occurrences with science!
%PLAYERNAME%, thanks so much for your help. I did some research on Ghost-type Pokémon, and I think there’s a Ghost- and Dark-type Pokémon that is bound to a strange stone.
I can’t say for sure just yet, but it seems this Pokémon may actually be composed of 108 spirits bound together. So maybe if we catch 108 Pokémon, it will appear?
Good luck, %PLAYERNAME%!  And...would you keep the light on in the lab for me? All this spooky research is making my hair stand on end.
Wow, %PLAYERNAME%! It seems we’ve had a spooky brush with Spiritomb!
I can’t tell if it’s the weather, but I’ve got the shivers! You know, I feel confident that we can solve anything together, %PLAYERNAME%, even when things get scary.
I'll be in touch soon!
Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! You surprised me, much like the Seedot that just fell from that tree over there.
It really scared a Pidgey that was foraging nearby, and I’m pretty sure it did that on purpose.
It’s easy for Seedot to trick people and Pokémon alike because Seedot are almost indistinguishable from acorns.
Are they appearing in higher numbers right now, or am I seeing double? Could you help me investigate this nutty situation?
Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! While you were away, I was just refreshing my memory on Seedot.
Apparently, it attaches itself to a tree branch using the top of its head and sucks moisture from the tree it’s hanging from. The more water Seedot drinks, the glossier its body becomes.
Thanks, Seedot, for reminding us to stay hydrated! Did you know that Seedot can evolve? AHHH! Sorry, I was just startled by another one.
Why don’t you try evolving Seedot? Maybe it’ll get calmer and stop playing pranks on everyone!
On the one hand, fantastic work, Trainer. Your little Seedot has evolved into Nuzleaf, the Wily Pokémon. On the other hand, our plan to calm Seedot down by evolving it has backfired.
Apparently, Nuzleaf can make a flute out of the leaf on its head, and the sound of that flute strikes fear and uncertainty into the hearts of people who hear it.
I’m sorry. But I have faith that a brave Trainer like yourself can handle Nuzleaf just fine!
Maybe if we try evolving it again...its next form will be less scary! Personally, I’ve been startled enough for one day of research!
So...your Nuzleaf has evolved into Shiftry, the Wicked Pokémon. Unfortunately, upon reviewing data on Shiftry, I learned it can be quite fearsome, too.
Using its leafy fan, Shiftry can create wind gusts with speeds of up to one hundred feet per second. That’s strong enough to level houses! I think I need to go tie my mobile lab down!
I’d rather be surprised by a Seedot than blown away by a Shiftry! Hah...lesson learned—stay up-to-date with Pokémon, even familiar ones!
Thank you for your help researching this odd occurrence. Once these winds die down, I’ll be in touch about our next research adventure!
Hello there, %PLAYERNAME%! I was just taking a moment to admire the weather here. Blue skies abound, with the fluffiest of clouds floating by.
I’d love to just kick back and enjoy the tranquility of it all, but I’ve observed some of the clouds moving rather...strangely.
Believe it or not, I believe some of them are actually flapping—yes, like birds!
The first few times I saw it, I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me, but as the motions grew more frequent, I began to suspect a Pokémon was involved. 
Mind going on a little jaunt to see what you can discover?
Welcome back, Trainer! What have you discovered?
Ah—Swablu! The Cotton Bird Pokémon. Hmm... It’s all beginning to make sense.
Swablu’s cotton-like wings are so fluffy and white that, alongside their sky-blue bodies, Swablu can be easily mistaken for clouds in the sky.
At least until you catch them flapping, eh? Haha!
Swablu apparently love to sit on people’s heads. They look like fluffy hats!
Ah, and there it goes! Right on your head. Good timing, Swablu!
Fond as they are of their human perches, Swablu will take flight right away if their wings get dirty. Cleanliness begets comfort, after all.
A fascinating Pokémon through and through, don’t you think?
Evolving Swablu takes some effort, but I assure you—it’s well worth it! I’m sure a Trainer of your talent could gather the necessary Candy in no time.
I’d love to see its Evolution in person, so could you evolve your Swablu for me? Be sure to use Pinap Berries to earn even more Candy!
Incredible work, %PLAYERNAME%! Looks like you’ve been hard at work catching Swablu.
Evolving Swablu is truly an act of patience, isn’t it?
Patience is often called a virtue in a broad sense, but it really is an integral part of being a great Trainer.
As the saying goes: good things come to those who wait!
All your hard work will feel justified once you witness your darling Swablu evolve. Of that, you have my word!
Just one more leg of this journey left to go, %PLAYERNAME%. Let's go!
Welcome back, Trainer! I see your efforts have paid off. Well done!
Swablu’s Evolution, Altaria, is called the Humming Pokémon.
It’s known to wrap its wings around the people it’s bonded with—much like yours is doing with you now.
And humming all the while! You know, people say that Altaria’s humming could enrapture an entire audience with its beauty, and it’s not hard to see why.
Between Altaria’s song and your remarkable bond, I have to say I’m feeling quite moved!
You truly are an incredible Trainer.
Thanks for your help on this latest adventure, %PLAYERNAME%. I’ll never get tired of learning more about Pokémon!
Now, let’s GO!
Hi there, %PLAYERNAME%. I can’t help but be impressed by your progress. You’ve done fantastic work in researching Pokémon originally discovered in the Kanto, Johto, Hoenn, and Sinnoh regions.
Now that we’ve researched Pokémon that were found in those regions...
let’s take a closer look at Pokémon originally discovered in the Unova region!
I think it’s fascinating that even though we know a lot about Pokémon from all over the world, there’s always more to learn!
Speaking of discoveries, I’ve been doing some additional research and heard about an interesting phenomenon that has to do with Meowth in the Galar region.
I was speaking to a researcher who’s the granddaughter of a colleague from Galar, and she shared some intriguing information.
It seems that Galarian Meowth lived with seafaring people, which toughened their bodies so much that parts of them turned to iron.
Maybe I could get a few workout tips—I’ve been looking for some ways to toughen up myself!
Anyway...let’s do some more research on Pokémon originally discovered in Unova, but be sure to keep your eyes open for other exciting discoveries.
Wonderful work, Trainer. You might be familiar with the tradition in which a Pokémon Trainer selects their very first partner from a group of three Pokémon.
These first-partner Pokémon are normally Fire, Water, or Grass types. In Unova, many Trainers choose the Water-type Oshawott as their first-partner Pokémon.
This Sea Otter Pokémon is known to use the scalchop on its stomach during battle. Isn’t that just adorable? Please continue your research, and let me know your findings.
I can’t stop thinking about how cute Oshawott is... Oh! You’re back! Excellent work catching that Darumaka!
Now that we’ve researched the Water-type first-partner Pokémon of many Trainers from Unova, let’s shift focus to the Fire-type one—Tepig!
I’m a particular fan of Tepig because it uses the fireballs that come from its nose to roast Berries. It’s such a clever use of a skill.
I just love roasted Pinap Berries! We should continue our work and see what else we can discover.
Being the savvy Trainer you are, I’m sure you know which type of Pokémon we’re going to research next.
That’s right—Grass type! In Unova, many Trainers choose the Grass Snake Pokémon Snivy as their first partner. Snivy is intelligent and calm, and being exposed to lots of sunlight makes it move more swiftly.
Perhaps there’s a lot we could learn from such a sagacious Pokémon!
Anyway, let’s get started on these research tasks. Be sure to listen carefully, as you never know what you might encounter!
You’re a natural, %PLAYERNAME%. I’m so glad we could research some of the amazing Pokémon originally discovered in the Unova region.
I can’t thank you enough for your hard work. I hope you put this Charged TM and Fast TM to good use!
By the way, I literally stumbled across a mysterious Pokémon I’ve never encountered before.
I think you’re the perfect Trainer to take this Pokémon and help it reach its potential. Best of luck, and I’ll be in touch soon!
Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! I stepped out of my mobile lab this morning only to see needlelike horns poking out of the grass all around me.
Luckily, I also saw big red noses poking out of the grass and realized they belonged to Weedle, the Hairy Bug Pokémon. I guess you could say we’re in a...hairy situation!
...Uh, moving along...
Weedle’s horn measures about two inches. It’s a sharp stinger that can inject poison!
Let’s investigate Weedle further—but watch your step! There are Weedle everywhere, and you wouldn’t want to get poked by one.
Nice footwork, Trainer. I read a fascinating tidbit while you were conducting your research—Weedle has an extremely acute sense of smell.
It finds its favorite kinds of leaves by sniffing them out with its big, red, and—in my opinion—honkable nose.
I can think of a number of times this useful skill would come in handy, like when the team leaders start sharing snacks around the lab and don’t think to offer me any.
Anyway, I think that we should look further into Weedle’s Evolution. I can’t wait to see what other fascinating details we learn.
Well done with that evolving, %PLAYERNAME%. However, it looks like the evolved form of Weedle, Kakuna, is just...sitting there. I knew this Cocoon Pokémon didn’t move much, but wow.
Seeing it in person has made me realize that...it really does just sit there. But while it seems like it’s doing nothing, it’s actually extremely busy preparing for its upcoming Evolution.
And that’s evident by how hot to the touch the shell becomes! Isn’t that exciting? Thanks to our research, we’ve learned so much about what’s happening to Kakuna!
Let’s keep going! I think that Kakuna of yours is almost ready to show you what it’s been working on.
Thanks to its hard work, Kakuna has evolved into Beedrill! It now has three poisonous stingers and wings that allow it to fly quickly. Talk about a glow-up!
Beedrill, the Poison Bee Pokémon, is known for being extremely territorial. It sometimes attacks in swarms, and Beedrill nests are very dangerous!
This powerful Bug- and Poison-type Pokémon may surprise you in Trainer Battles, too.
Thanks for your help today, %PLAYERNAME%. I’ll be in touch once I figure out how to maneuver my mobile lab out of this area. I wouldn’t want a Weedle poking a hole in one of the mobile lab’s tires!
%PLAYERNAME%! Thank goodness you made it to this important research site.
I came to study Pokémon that commonly appear in this area, but it seems I need your help! The species of Pokémon I’ve observed today don’t normally appear around here. What a strange occurrence!
Would you be willing to travel throughout the park and perform some tasks for me? With all these wild Pokémon around, it almost feels like a safari!
Please complete the following research tasks: {0}{1}{2}{3}{4}
Wow, great work today! In addition to completing some insightful research, you’ve skillfully helped me document the amazing nature around us and the fascinating migration patterns that Pokémon follow. I have a feeling there’s even more to discover out here!
The results of your work have produced an awesome amount of Stardust. Perhaps you could find good use for it in powering up or trading a Pokémon! Enjoy, %PLAYERNAME%!

Ah, %PLAYERNAME%! Good to see you!
There’s a lot to do this summer! New things to experience—new Pokémon to find!
Let’s start with a few simple tasks to help you get your bearings.
Wow, is that a Dratini you’ve found? That’s quite a rare Pokémon!
I can tell this Dratini has the potential to become a close friend of yours! Why don’t you two take some time to get to know each other?
Impressive! Dragonair is a powerful Pokémon in its own right. Let’s get Dragonair ready to battle!
You can try taking on other Trainers or working together to take down huge Raid Bosses!
Nice work! You and your Pokémon make a great team!
There are many new kinds of Pokémon that have started appearing recently in the world.
You should take a look and see if you can find anything new.
Amazing! You found some rare Pokémon that were first discovered in the Sinnoh region already? And is that...a Shiny Pokémon?
Amazing! I’ve never seen an Eevee like that before! Shiny Pokémon have a rare and distinct coloration that sets them apart from others of their species!
Let’s commemorate this moment! Why don’t you take a snapshot and celebrate with friends?
Wow, a wild Lapras sought you out?
Looks like you’re going to do great this summer!
They say Trainers and Pokémon are most powerful when they band together.
Good luck! It’s time to GO!

This is probably a waste of my time, but I do love winning!
This won’t be all bad—when you lose, you’ll at least get to hear me say you made a good effort.
I won’t be surprised when I win.
It will be good for you to see a true Trainer like me in battle.
If you are as weak as your team leaders, then this fight will be easy.
You should probably take notes, dear.
I’ll never pass up an opportunity to show off on the battlefield!
Can we move this along? I’d love to stay and chat, but I have a meeting to get to.
You shouldn’t get in my way. You might get hurt, dear.
This is a challenge you should walk away from, dear.
I’ve lost my touch... But it will not happen again.
I underestimated you, but I will not make the same mistake again.
I can’t lose... What does this mean?
You win this time, but things’ll go differently next time we meet!
Ugh, these Pokémon are too weak for a Trainer like me!
How amusing! You dare to challenge me?
I’m not fond of dealing with weaklings. Pay attention! You might learn something.
Such an eager Trainer. I’ll happily defeat you.
Your inevitable loss will be such a good lesson.
Pay attention, Trainer. You just might learn something!
I’m getting tired of battling weaklings. Let’s get this over with.
Silly Trainer. You ought to know better than to oppose me.
You’ve had your fun. Now it’s time for you to fight me.
I can see this will be a struggle for you. Don’t worry. I’ll defeat you quickly.
It’s so cute how willing you are to accept your defeat. Let’s battle.
I wish I could enjoy this victory, but it wasn’t a surprise!
...Oh? You’re still here?
Move along, dear. Team GO Rocket always wins.
How...simple.
Come back when you can actually pose a challenge, dear!

Whoa—not a signal in sight! I wonder what they’re scared of?
Just when I was energized to do some battling! Maybe we should check out other locations.
No signals? Well, it is getting pretty late...and I need to go meet up with Willow.
We might have better luck catching them during the daytime, when Candela and I usually get most of our research done.

I'm Candela—Team Valor's leader!
Pokémon are stronger than humans, and they're warmhearted, too!
I'm researching ways to enhance Pokémon's natural power in the pursuit of true strength.
There's no doubt that the Pokémon our team have trained are the strongest in battle!
Are you ready?

Hey! The name's Spark—the leader of Team Instinct.
Pokémon are creatures with excellent intuition.
I bet the secret to their intuition is related to how they're hatched.
