To protect your information we recommend that you carefully review the privacy policies of all Third Party Service that you access.<br><br>11. Game Specific Disclosures<br><br>Additional Privacy Information for Pokémon GO<br><br>Pokémon Trainer Club Accounts. You can sign up for Pokémon GO using your third-party Pokémon Trainer Club (“PTC”) account administered by The Pokémon Company International (“TPCI”). If you choose to do so, we will collect from TPCI your PTC registered email address, your PTC username and a unique PTC user ID. If you are registering your PTC account on behalf of your authorized child we will also collect some Personal Data about your child. See the “Accounts with Children” paragraph below for more information.<br><br>Accounts with Children. We comply with parental consent requirements as mandated by the U.S. Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and European data protection laws (including, without limitation, the General Data Protection Regulation) through a verification and consent process handled by TPCI. As described in the Pokémon GO Terms of Service, the parent or legal guardian (“Parent”) of each child under the age of 13, or in the EEA 16 or the age needed to consent to the processing of personal data (“Child”), must register with TPCI through a PTC account before their Child can access and use the game. The Parent will have to provide to TPCI certain Personal Data about the Child in accordance with the TPCI privacy policy. Of that, Niantic will only collect from TPCI the Child’s personal email address, and the date when the Child will grow out of the age limits listed above.<br><br>For U.S. residents, after a Parent has registered a PTC account, TPCI will verify the Parent’s identity by asking for the sum of the first and last digits of the Parent’s social security number and the Parent’s name, date of birth, and street address. TPCI will not share that information with us. After TPCI verifies the Parent’s identity, it will ask the Parent to consent to the Child accessing Pokémon GO. If a Parent does not consent to a Child’s access to and use of Pokémon GO or does not verify their identity through the consent process, Niantic will bar that Child’s registration on Pokémon GO and prevent the Child’s access to and use of the game.<br><br>Parents have the right to refuse further collection, use, and/or disclosure of their Child’s Personal Data by notifying us. As a Parent, you understand that Niantic has a legitimate interest in providing your Child’s information collected via the Services to third party providers for the sole purpose of administering or providing the Services, as described in Paragraph 3 of this Privacy Policy.<br><br>Information shared with other players. When you take certain actions in Pokémon GO and capture a Gym, your (or your authorized Child’s) username will be shared publicly through the game, including with other players, in connection with that Gym location.<br><br>Apple Watch and Apple Health App Data. If you use Pokémon GO with your Apple Watch, with your consent we use the Apple HealthKit APIs to read and/or write certain data about your fitness activity (Step Count, Calories Burned, and Distance Walked) to the Health App Database on your device (the “Health App Data”).   We may store Health App Data on our servers in connection with your Pokémon GO user account.   We use Health App Data to provide you certain functionality in the game (such as distances walked to hatch Eggs), and to ensure you get “credit” in your Apple Health App for all of the walking you do while playing Pokémon GO.  We will not use Health App Data for marketing or advertising purposes.  We do not store Health App Data in iCloud.  Pokémon GO cannot read from or write to the Health App Database without your consent.<br>Additional Privacy Information for Ingress<br><br>Information shared publicly. When you play Ingress, as part of the gameplay the following information about you will be shared through the game (including with other players directly within the app, in game notifications emailed to other players as part of the gameplay, and online on the Ingress Intel Map website), and will therefore become publicly available: your in-game username, messages sent to other users in COMMS, and in-game portals that you interact with, as well as your device location whenever you take an in-game action.<br>"
