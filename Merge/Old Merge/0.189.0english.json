"gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_2_5", "Your Golem might be a helpful addition to your battle party, since Flying types are weak to Rock-type attacks! %PLAYERNAME%, it\u2019s time to rock Team GO Rocket\u2019s world and save those Legendary Shadow Pok\u00e9mon!",

"pokemon_desc_0002", "There is a bud on this Pok\u00e9mon's back. To support its weight, Ivysaur's legs and trunk grow thick and strong. If it starts spending more time lying in the sunlight, it's a sign that the bud will bloom into a large flower soon.",
"pokemon_desc_0003", "There is a large flower on Venusaur's back. The flower is said to take on vivid colors if it gets plenty of nutrition and sunlight. The flower's aroma soothes the emotions of people.",
"pokemon_desc_0004", "The flame that burns at the tip of its tail is an indication of its emotions. The flame wavers when Charmander is enjoying itself. If the Pok\u00e9mon becomes enraged, the flame burns fiercely.",

Game Specific Disclosures<br><br>Additional Privacy Information for Pok\u00e9mon GO<br><br>Pok\u00e9mon Trainer Club Accounts. You can sign up for Pok\u00e9mon GO using your third-party Pok\u00e9mon Trainer Club (\u201cPTC\u201d) account administered by The Pok\u00e9mon Company International (\u201cTPCI\u201d). If you choose to do so, we will collect from TPCI your PTC registered email address, your PTC username and a unique PTC user ID. If you are registering your PTC account on behalf of your authorized child we will also collect some Personal Data about your child. See the \u201cAccounts with Children\u201d paragraph below for more information.<br><br>Accounts with Children. We comply with parental consent requirements as mandated by the U.S. Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and European data protection laws (including, without limitation, the General Data Protection Regulation) through a verification and consent process handled by TPCI. As described in the Pok\u00e9mon GO Terms of Service, the parent or legal guardian (\u201cParent\u201d) of each child under the age of 13, or in the EEA 16 or the age needed to consent to the processing of personal data (\u201cChild\u201d), must register with TPCI through a PTC account before their Child can access and use the game. The Parent will have to provide to TPCI certain Personal Data about the Child in accordance with the TPCI privacy policy. Of that, Niantic will only collect from TPCI the Child\u2019s personal email address, and the date when the Child will grow out of the age limits listed above.<br><br>For U.S. residents, after a Parent has registered a PTC account, TPCI will verify the Parent\u2019s identity by asking for the sum of the first and last digits of the Parent\u2019s social security number and the Parent\u2019s name, date of birth, and street address. TPCI will not share that information with us. After TPCI verifies the Parent\u2019s identity, it will ask the Parent to consent to the Child accessing Pok\u00e9mon GO. If a Parent does not consent to a Child\u2019s access to and use of Pok\u00e9mon GO or does not verify their identity through the consent process, Niantic will bar that Child\u2019s registration on Pok\u00e9mon GO and prevent the Child\u2019s access to and use of the game.<br><br>Parents have the right to refuse further collection, use, and/or disclosure of their Child\u2019s Personal Data by notifying us. As a Parent, you understand that Niantic has a legitimate interest in providing your Child\u2019s information collected via the Services to third party providers for the sole purpose of administering or providing the Services, as described in Paragraph 3 of this Privacy Policy.<br><br>Information shared with other players. When you take certain actions in Pok\u00e9mon GO and capture a Gym, your (or your authorized Child\u2019s) username will be shared publicly through the game, including with other players, in connection with that Gym location.<br><br>Apple Watch and Apple Health App Data. If you use Pok\u00e9mon GO with your Apple Watch, with your consent we use the Apple HealthKit APIs to read and/or write certain data about your fitness activity (Step Count, Calories Burned, and Distance Walked) to the Health App Database on your device (the \u201cHealth App Data\u201d).   We may store Health App Data on our servers in connection with your Pok\u00e9mon GO user account.   We use Health App Data to provide you certain functionality in the game (such as distances walked to hatch Eggs), and to ensure you get \u201ccredit\u201d in your Apple Health App for all of the walking you do while playing Pok\u00e9mon GO.  We will not use Health App Data for marketing or advertising purposes.  We do not store Health App Data in iCloud.  Pok\u00e9mon GO cannot read from or write to the Health App Database without your consent.<br>Additional Privacy Information for Ingress<br><br>Information shared publicly. When you play Ingress, as part of the gameplay the following information about you will be shared through the game (including with other players directly within the app, in game notifications emailed to other players as part of the gameplay, and online on the Ingress Intel Map website), and will therefore become publicly available: your in-game username, messages sent to other users in COMMS, and in-game portals that you interact with, as well as your device location whenever you take an in-game action.<br>",

"quest_dialogue_genesect_2_1", "Anyway...the damage can\u2019t have been caused by a Trainer Battle. I\u2019ve never seen anything like it before. It seems almost...unnatural?",
"quest_dialogue_genesect_2_2", "Could it really have been caused by Pok\u00e9mon? This is getting fascinating! Could you do some research on Water-type Pok\u00e9mon for me?",
"quest_dialogue_genesect_2_3", "As I followed the damage trail further, the burned area suddenly ended and strange water damage started appearing, and it just doesn\u2019t seem to line up with any Pok\u00e9mon I\u2019ve encountered.",
"quest_dialogue_genesect_3_0", "%PLAYERNAME%, I\u2019m so glad you\u2019re back! We might have stumbled upon something incredible.",

"quest_dialogue_genesect_3_3", "Pretty cool, huh? The notes say that though this Pok\u00e9mon is Bug and Steel type, it\u2019s known to be able to use attacks with types like Fire and Water, among others.",
"quest_dialogue_genesect_3_4", "This lines up with the damage at the site we\u2019ve been researching!",
"quest_dialogue_genesect_3_5", "One of the other types Genesect can attack with is Electric, and as I kept following the damage trail, I found spots that must have been hit by some kind of high-voltage Electric-type attack.",
"quest_dialogue_genesect_3_6", "I\u2019ll see if anything else lies even farther down the trail, but in the meantime, I know I can count on you to start investigating Electric-type Pok\u00e9mon to help us get to the bottom of this.",
"quest_dialogue_genesect_4_0", "I can\u2019t thank you enough for your help, %PLAYERNAME%. You really are my Special Research good-luck charm!",
"quest_dialogue_genesect_4_1", "With the information you collected combined with the notes from Unova, I think we\u2019ve uncovered the Bug- and Steel-type Pok\u00e9mon Genesect!",
"quest_dialogue_genesect_4_2", "I know what you\u2019re thinking: Bug AND Steel with such odd attack types?",
"quest_dialogue_genesect_4_3", "Apparently, when this Pok\u00e9mon is holding a specially developed item called a Drive, its Techno Blast attack changes to a type that corresponds to the Drive the Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s holding.",
"quest_dialogue_genesect_4_4", "I wonder what kinds of Drives exist for this Pok\u00e9mon.",
"quest_dialogue_genesect_4_5", "I still have so many questions, but for now, why not do a little research on Ice-type Pok\u00e9mon? I hear Ice is another type Genesect can wield.",

"quest_dialogue_gigas_0_0", "Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%. Good to see you again. Your research inspired me to do some more research of my own, and I think I\u2019ve come across something...groundbreaking.",
"quest_dialogue_gigas_0_1", "I was investigating the digging patterns of Diglett, and I wound up heading deep into a cave. Inside, I came across some unusual markings carved heavily into the cavern walls. ",
"quest_dialogue_gigas_0_2", "At first, I thought them to be random, but then I realized the carvings formed four unique patterns, each consisting of seven circles.",
"quest_dialogue_gigas_0_3", "These patterns look incredibly familiar, and I think we need to take a closer look at some Pok\u00e9mon in particular.",
"quest_dialogue_gigas_0_4", "Can I count on you to help me research some Rock-type Pok\u00e9mon?  I have a hunch that this will lead us to our first clue.",
"quest_dialogue_gigas_1_0", "Simply amazing! The pattern on the Regirock you caught matches perfectly with the first pattern of carvings on the cave walls.",
"quest_dialogue_gigas_1_1", "This leads me to believe we should move our investigation to Ice-type Pok\u00e9mon. I wonder if we\u2019ll find another Pok\u00e9mon that will help us solve this puzzle.",
"quest_dialogue_gigas_1_2", "I have one in mind, but I don\u2019t want to get ahead of myself!",
"quest_dialogue_gigas_1_3", "I\u2019m sure with the help of an accomplished Trainer such as yourself, we\u2019ll be on our way to figuring this out in no time.",
"quest_dialogue_gigas_2_0", "As expected, Regice clearly has similar markings to the second carving I found in the cave.",
"quest_dialogue_gigas_2_1", "I remember an ancient legend that told a story about a Colossal Pok\u00e9mon. It\u2019s said that it made Pok\u00e9mon that looked like itself from a special ice mountain, rocks, and magma.",
"quest_dialogue_gigas_2_2", "Could it be these Pok\u00e9mon these patterns originate from? This is starting to get exciting, isn\u2019t it?",
"quest_dialogue_gigas_2_3", "If the first two Pok\u00e9mon were Regirock and Regice...then there\u2019s only one left that we must research further.",
"quest_dialogue_gigas_3_0", "Excellent work. I believe we\u2019re going in the right direction. This could only mean one thing, %PLAYERNAME%.",
"quest_dialogue_gigas_3_1", "We\u2019re close to coming across the Legendary Pok\u00e9mon Regigigas! According to legend, this Pok\u00e9mon towed continents with rope.",
"quest_dialogue_gigas_3_2", "Maybe it can help move my research lab next time it gets stuck. Hahaha!",
"quest_dialogue_gigas_3_3", "Anyway...I have a feeling that once you fully document these amazing creatures, you\u2019ll make a colossal discovery of your own.",
"quest_dialogue_jirachi_0_0", "Welcome to GO Fest 2019, %PLAYERNAME%! I\u2019m glad you\u2019re here.",
"quest_dialogue_jirachi_0_1", "I discovered something fascinating during my research, and I need your help. I\u2019ve come across what I believe to be a rare Pok\u00e9mon deep in slumber.",
"quest_dialogue_jirachi_0_2", "We have our work cut out for us, %PLAYERNAME%. I think this adventure is going to call for some resources and even the help of some friends.",
"quest_dialogue_jirachi_0_3", "Could you collect some supplies? Meanwhile, I\u2019ll see if I can find anything about this Pok\u00e9mon in any of my texts.",
"quest_dialogue_jirachi_1_0", "Good work, %PLAYERNAME%. I\u2019m sure the resources you\u2019ve earned will be crucial.",
"quest_dialogue_jirachi_1_1", "I had some success in my research, as well. I came across an ancient text containing the story of a Mythical Pok\u00e9mon that grants wishes.",
"quest_dialogue_jirachi_1_2", "I\u2019m still researching the best way to awaken this Pok\u00e9mon, but I keep hearing reports of other Pok\u00e9mon in the area showing signs of distress.",
"quest_dialogue_jirachi_1_3", "Could I ask you to investigate these reports?",
"quest_dialogue_jirachi_2_0", "Well done, %PLAYERNAME%! I knew I could count on you. You know, something interesting came up when I reviewed your results.",
"quest_dialogue_jirachi_2_1", "Many of the Pok\u00e9mon you encountered seem to have strayed from their habitats.",
"quest_dialogue_jirachi_2_2", "I\u2019d like you to help them get back to their proper habitats, as I\u2019m sure this will soothe them and make them more comfortable. This should be a breeze for an accomplished Trainer like you!",
"quest_dialogue_jirachi_2_3", "As you return the Pok\u00e9mon to their proper habitats, be sure to snap pictures to help document this unusual situation.",
"quest_dialogue_jirachi_3_0", "Wonderful work, %PLAYERNAME%! You\u2019re certainly getting the hang of that camera! Did you notice anything strange while taking photos of Pok\u00e9mon in their habitats?",
"quest_dialogue_jirachi_3_1", "Apparently there\u2019s an unusual phenomenon where Pok\u00e9mon leap out in an attempt to appear in your photos. I\u2019ve heard Spark refer to it as a \u201cphotobomb.\u201d",
"quest_dialogue_jirachi_3_2", "I\u2019m eternally amused\u2014and amazed\u2014by the things we learn about Pok\u00e9mon every day. That said, I did notice a connection.",
"quest_dialogue_jirachi_3_3", "These Pok\u00e9mon all seem to have something in common\u2014music! I have a hunch that music may be the key to awakening our slumbering Pok\u00e9mon.",

"quest_special_dialogue_gt_2_1", "It\u2019s said that Haunter lurks in walls to keep an eye on its foes, but in this case, I have a feeling it\u2019s just being playful.",
"quest_special_dialogue_gt_2_2", "I\u2019ve noticed the team leaders tripping and stumbling around the lab today. Seems as if Haunter is having a bit of fun with them, but I don\u2019t think Blanche is amused.",

"quest_special_dialogue_gt_3_1", "If you ever see your shadow suddenly and startlingly overtake you, it might be a Gengar running past you, pretending to be your shadow!",

"quest_special_dialogue_gt_3_5", "Anyway, I know an accomplished Trainer such as yourself has nothing to fear when it comes to training a Pok\u00e9mon like Gengar. Being both Poison- and Ghost-type, it\u2019s a fantastic Pok\u00e9mon to have on your team.",

"quest_special_dialogue_magit_0_1", "All morning, I\u2019ve been hearing the distinct sound of splashing water. While somewhat relaxing, it\u2019s definitely not a normal thing to hear around the lab.",
"quest_special_dialogue_magit_0_2", "Upon further investigation, I noticed an increased number of Magikarp in the wild. It was quite the sight to see so many of them splashing about.",
"quest_special_dialogue_magit_0_3", "Guess it\u2019s time to GO fishing! Get it? Because Magikarp is the Fish Pok\u00e9mon?",
"quest_special_dialogue_magit_0_4", "Anyway, I think it\u2019ll be safe to approach Magikarp, as documentation indicates they\u2019re harmless.",
"quest_special_dialogue_magit_0_5", "However, I see potential in this Pok\u00e9mon. It\u2019s time to head out and investigate.",
"quest_special_dialogue_magit_1_0", "Great work, Trainer! While you were out, I did a bit of a refresher on Magikarp.",
"quest_special_dialogue_magit_1_1", "Did you know that some Magikarp can jump so high, they can leap over a mountain? Now that\u2019s something I\u2019d like to see!",
"quest_special_dialogue_magit_1_2", "Also, while having a reputation for being worthless, this hardy Pok\u00e9mon can thrive in any body of water, regardless of how dirty or polluted the water might be.",
"quest_special_dialogue_magit_1_3", "I think Magikarp deserves a bit more credit, don\u2019t you think? Let\u2019s focus on evolving Magikarp, since doing so takes some effort.",
"quest_special_dialogue_magit_1_4", "Maybe you should try using Pinap Berries when trying to catch Magikarp. Not only are Pinap Berries tasty, but they\u2019re quite useful as well!",
"quest_special_dialogue_magit_2_0", "Good job, %PLAYERNAME%. Thanks to the research you\u2019ve completed, it\u2019s time to evolve that Magikarp of yours!",
"quest_special_dialogue_magit_2_1", "Remember when I said that Magikarp is harmless? Well, that isn\u2019t the case with its evolved form, Gyarados.",
"quest_special_dialogue_magit_2_2", "Known as the Atrocious Pok\u00e9mon, Gyarados has a reputation for being destructive. Tales of its rampaging nature are consistent across all research materials we have on it.",
"quest_special_dialogue_magit_2_3", "So much for being harmless, am I right? Of note, Gyarados is both Water- and Flying-type\u2014something you might not expect from its humble beginnings.",
"quest_special_dialogue_magit_2_4", "Looks like you\u2019ll be adding a powerful Pok\u00e9mon to your team, but let\u2019s proceed with caution.",
"quest_special_dialogue_magit_3_0", "Wonderful work, %PLAYERNAME%. Looks like all your efforts have paid off, and you\u2019ve got yourself a Gyarados.",
"quest_special_dialogue_magit_3_1", "I\u2019m sure this Pok\u00e9mon will be a great member of your team when battling other Trainers or even Team GO Rocket!",
"quest_special_dialogue_magit_3_2", "Even though Gyarados is known for being vicious and extremely aggressive, a talented Trainer such as yourself will be able to befriend and train it so it can meet its full potential.",
"quest_special_dialogue_magit_3_3", "I\u2019m excited to see what kinds of challenges you\u2019ll demolish together!",
"quest_special_dialogue_magit_3_4", "Just make sure that the demolition is limited to battles\u2014not entire cities.",
"quest_special_dialogue_magit_3_5", "Anyway, until next time!",
"quest_special_dialogue_megabee_0_0", "Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! I think I\u2019ve got an exciting adventure for you. I\u2019ve been working on something...BIG.",
"quest_special_dialogue_megabee_0_1", "Recently, we observed a large number of Weedle appearing in the wild. I wanted to investigate that phenomenon further.",
"quest_special_dialogue_megabee_0_2", "After a day of research, I saw something sparkling in the tall grass near where the Weedle were gathering.",
"quest_special_dialogue_megabee_0_3", "It turned out to be a smooth, stonelike object with a symbol etched into it. It glowed with an energy I\u2019ve never encountered before!",
"quest_special_dialogue_megabee_0_4", "I\u2019d seen that symbol before in documents about Mega Evolution that I received from my colleague in Kalos, Professor Sycamore. That led me to believe that the object was somehow related.",
"quest_special_dialogue_megabee_0_5", "After digging further into the documents, I theorized that Pok\u00e9mon can Mega Evolve using the energy from the object I found, which I named Mega Energy.",
"quest_special_dialogue_megabee_0_6", "It also occurred to me that the object I found might be related to Weedle.",
"quest_special_dialogue_megabee_0_7", "Now that I\u2019ve caught you up on my BIG discovery, let\u2019s get started on some research. We\u2019ll need a Weedle\u2014I think that Pok\u00e9mon has mega potential!",
"quest_special_dialogue_megabee_1_0", "Great work, %PLAYERNAME%! Let\u2019s document our findings for other Trainers.",
"quest_special_dialogue_megabee_1_1", "Now, Weedle can\u2019t Mega Evolve, but its final Evolution, Beedrill, can.",
"quest_special_dialogue_megabee_1_2", "My theory is that there is Mega Energy for different Pok\u00e9mon and that each Pok\u00e9mon needs a certain amount of Mega Energy to Mega Evolve.",
"quest_special_dialogue_megabee_1_3", "It also seems that Mega-Evolved Pok\u00e9mon return to normal once their Mega Energy is depleted.",
"quest_special_dialogue_megabee_1_4", "It may be difficult to gather the Mega Energy needed to Mega Evolve a Pok\u00e9mon for the first time. However, it seems that once a Pok\u00e9mon has Mega Evolved, it requires less Mega Energy to do so again.",
"quest_special_dialogue_megabee_1_5", "Maybe it\u2019s because Mega Evolution strengthens a Trainer\u2019s bond with their Pok\u00e9mon.",
"quest_special_dialogue_megabee_1_6", "Let\u2019s continue this investigation. How about you evolve your Weedle to its final Evolution and see whether you can find enough Mega Energy to Mega Evolve your new Beedrill.",
"quest_special_dialogue_megabee_2_0", "Again, you never cease to amaze me, %PLAYERNAME%. I think you and Beedrill are going to be great partners.",
"quest_special_dialogue_megabee_2_1", "I\u2019ve learned that some other Pok\u00e9mon can Mega Evolve, too.",
"quest_special_dialogue_megabee_2_2", "While I\u2019ve been able to confirm only a few, I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll discover more in time. At this point, you should be able to Mega Evolve your Beedrill, if you\u2019re ready.",
"quest_special_dialogue_megabee_2_3", "Now, I\u2019m sure you are going to ask, \u201cProfessor Willow, how do I get Mega Energy for other Pok\u00e9mon?\u201d",
"quest_special_dialogue_megabee_2_4", "Well, don\u2019t worry, Trainer. Mega Venusaur, Mega Charizard, and Mega Blastoise are appearing in Mega Raids all around the world. It appears you can get Mega Energy by challenging those Mega-Evolved Pok\u00e9mon.",
"quest_special_dialogue_megabee_2_5", "Why don\u2019t you Mega Evolve your Beedrill and battle with it in Mega Raids? There seem to be benefits to battling in raids alongside Mega-Evolved Pok\u00e9mon for both you and your fellow Trainers.",
"quest_special_dialogue_megabee_2_6", "I\u2019m curious to see what effect Mega-Evolved Pok\u00e9mon have on other Pok\u00e9mon when they battle together. Why don\u2019t you give it a try!",
"quest_special_dialogue_megabee_3_0", "I dare say, this was a successful research project! It looks like you were able to acquire some Mega Energy by battling those Mega-Evolved Pok\u00e9mon.",
"quest_special_dialogue_megabee_3_1", "I\u2019ve documented that you and your Mega-Evolved Pok\u00e9mon can do many other things together, too.",
"quest_special_dialogue_megabee_3_2", "I hope to see you and your Mega-Evolved Pok\u00e9mon battling at Gyms, challenging other Trainers, combating Team GO Rocket, and, of course, taking some snapshots to send back to yours truly.",
"quest_special_dialogue_megabee_3_3", "Mega-Evolved Pok\u00e9mon are extremely powerful, so I think it\u2019s best that we don\u2019t bring our new friends into the GO Battle League just yet, at least until more research is done.",
"quest_special_dialogue_megabee_3_4", "I wanted to give you a token of my appreciation for all your hard work on this project\u2014a Mega Bracelet!",
"quest_special_dialogue_megabee_3_5", "In other regions, Trainers use Mega Bracelets to help their Pok\u00e9mon Mega Evolve. Based on my research into Mega Energy, it seems you won\u2019t need a Mega Bracelet to Mega Evolve your Pok\u00e9mon.",
"quest_special_dialogue_megabee_3_6", "However, I thought a Mega Bracelet would be a trendy way to show off your Mega Evolution skills.",
"quest_special_dialogue_megabee_3_7", "You can check it out when you want to change up your look. I hope you accept this gift with my sincerest thanks for a job well done.",
"quest_special_dialogue_megabee_3_8", "Until next time, let\u2019s GO!",
"quest_special_dialogue_meltan_0_0", "%PLAYERNAME%, it\u2019s always great to see you! I\u2019m sure you know this, but your help in progressing my research has been essential to major breakthroughs in my work.",
"quest_special_dialogue_meltan_0_1", "That\u2019s why I\u2019ve come to talk to you again. You probably already know what I\u2019ll be asking!",
"quest_special_dialogue_meltan_0_2", "I need your assistance in learning more about the newly discovered Pok\u00e9mon that has really sent me and other Pok\u00e9mon researchers into quite a tizzy.",
"quest_special_dialogue_meltan_0_3", "Can you believe an undiscovered Pok\u00e9mon just appeared out of the blue? You can imagine how everyone is talking about it!",
"quest_special_dialogue_meltan_0_4", "I was checking a nearby habitat when I ran into a nest of them, and I was so excited, I dropped my camera! Don\u2019t worry, though... I\u2019m sure the repairs won\u2019t cost me too much at the shop...",
"quest_special_dialogue_meltan_0_5", "Although each Pok\u00e9mon turned out to be a Ditto using the move Transform, that didn\u2019t put a damper on my day!",
"quest_special_dialogue_meltan_0_6", "So many Ditto taking on this unique Pok\u00e9mon form must mean that the real Pok\u00e9mon is truly out there, just waiting to be found.",
"quest_special_dialogue_meltan_0_7", "Let\u2019s get to work, %PLAYERNAME%! I know we don\u2019t have much to go on, but I\u2019m confident your hard work can only bring us good fortune!",
"quest_special_dialogue_meltan_0_8", "But first, let me recalibrate my instruments for your area. Could you please complete the following tasks?\n{0}\n{1}\n{2}",
"quest_special_dialogue_meltan_1_0", "Thanks, %PLAYERNAME%! I think that will be enough to help me properly conduct calculations based on the data you\u2019ll gather in the field.",
"quest_special_dialogue_meltan_1_1", "While you were out, I scanned some academic journals to see if any of my fellow researchers have encountered a Pok\u00e9mon matching the description of the species I saw, but I didn\u2019t have much luck.",
"quest_special_dialogue_meltan_1_2", "But I do have a hunch! Given that this Pok\u00e9mon has been unseen until just recently, I think it\u2019s safe to say that we\u2019re tracking another Mythical Pok\u00e9mon, like Mew and Celebi.",
"quest_special_dialogue_meltan_1_3", "If I\u2019m right and this elusive Pok\u00e9mon is a Mythical Pok\u00e9mon, we should be able to draw it out by creating specific conditions under which it thrives.",
"quest_special_dialogue_meltan_1_4", "But let\u2019s step back for a minute, before we take a step forward. Or many steps forward, in this case! Great fieldwork starts with a walk. Could you complete a few tasks for me?",
"quest_special_dialogue_meltan_1_5", "Also, remind me to contact my mentor, Professor Oak. I\u2019m certain his brilliant mind will have something to lend to all this...",
"quest_special_dialogue_meltan_1_6", "Please complete the following tasks.\n{0}\n{1}\n{2}",
"quest_special_dialogue_meltan_2_0", "%PLAYERNAME%, I gave Professor Oak a call, and he pulled through! He says that the Pok\u00e9mon is called Meltan! I think the name has a nice ring to it\u2014don\u2019t you?",
"quest_special_dialogue_meltan_2_1", "Professor Oak got this information through an ancient text found in his archives, which included the appearance of Meltan.",
"quest_special_dialogue_meltan_2_2", "What luck! Did you know that when Professor Oak was my instructor, he was my role model? And he still is!",
"quest_special_dialogue_meltan_2_3", "He and I are of the same opinion that Meltan is a Mythical Pok\u00e9mon, so I really think we\u2019re on to something!",
"quest_special_dialogue_meltan_2_4", "Still, a name alone isn\u2019t going to get us very far... Perhaps the Ditto know something we don\u2019t?",
"quest_special_dialogue_meltan_2_5", "I think that if we find Ditto, we\u2019ll be able to figure out how they acquired this curious transformation, and maybe that will lead us to Meltan.",
"quest_special_dialogue_meltan_2_6", "Observation will be the best way forward, so let\u2019s roll up our sleeves and get to work!",
"quest_special_dialogue_meltan_2_7", "Please complete the following tasks.\n{0}\n{1}\n{2}",
"quest_special_dialogue_meltan_3_0", "Excellent work, %PLAYERNAME%! The Ditto you\u2019ve helped me analyze indeed has transformed into Meltan before. In fact, it was able to use Transform and let me analyze Meltan up close!",
"quest_special_dialogue_meltan_3_1", "This Ditto was very helpful, even though it couldn\u2019t replicate some of the finer details. It seems the memory of Meltan is fading away...",
"quest_special_dialogue_meltan_3_2", "But I have good news! I was able to tell that Meltan has a liquid-metal body with a nutlike head and a tail that looks like a power cord. Judging from the appearance, it may be an Electric- or Steel-type Pok\u00e9mon.",

"quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_1_1", "I remember the first time we came across Shadow Pok\u00e9mon. It was heartbreaking to see the pain they were in, and I knew I had to do something.",

"quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_1_1", "Even though we\u2019ve been fighting off the threat of Team GO Rocket for some time, I\u2019m still concerned about the fact that Shadow Pok\u00e9mon keep appearing.",
"quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_1_2", "It seems even more Pok\u00e9mon are being turned into Shadow Pok\u00e9mon despite our efforts. I\u2019ve been tracking this situation, and the numbers have almost tripled since all this began.",
"quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_1_3", "We need to keep pushing forward\u2014those Pok\u00e9mon need our help! Can I rely on you to purify more Shadow Pok\u00e9mon?",

"quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_2_3", "Use your battle skills to take on some Grunts. I think with some further observation, I can figure out what you need to do to make sure you\u2019re at your best!",
"quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_3_0", "All right! You should feel proud of your progress, %PLAYERNAME%. You consistently impress me and the team leaders.",

"quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_4_1", "It\u2019s time for you to use the Super Rocket Radar to track down the boss himself.",
"quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_4_2", "You\u2019ve proven not only your strength in battle but also your compassion through saving and purifying Shadow Pok\u00e9mon.",
"quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_4_3", "Confront Giovanni with that strength and compassion, and I believe he won\u2019t be able to stop you!",
"quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_4_4", "Good luck, %PLAYERNAME%!",
"quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_5_0", "Well done, %PLAYERNAME%. You\u2019ve shown Team GO Rocket just how strong your training has made you.",
"quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_5_1", "Although your battle with Giovanni wasn\u2019t easy, the skills you\u2019ve learned through practice and patience have paid off.",

"quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_0_1", "Congrats on coming so far as a Trainer! You constantly impress me with your skills.",
"quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_0_2", "But there are so many aspects to Pok\u00e9mon training! I think it\u2019s time to switch things up. I spoke with Spark, and he thought it would be good for you to focus some more on taking care of Pok\u00e9mon Eggs.",
"quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_0_3", "Why not take a walk with your buddy Pok\u00e9mon after placing some Eggs into Incubators?",
"quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_0_4", "And be sure to rescue Shadow Pok\u00e9mon from any Team GO Rocket members you encounter, too. Those Pok\u00e9mon still need our help!",
"quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_1_0", "Wonderful work, %PLAYERNAME%. While you were busy, I met up with Blanche to discuss our research on recent developments with Shadow Pok\u00e9mon.",
"quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_1_1", "I had observed that Team GO Rocket somehow seemed to be making Shadow Pok\u00e9mon deal more damage with their attacks, though they also seem to take more damage in return now. My observations line up with Blanche\u2019s research.",
"quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_1_2", "Both of us are concerned that despite our best efforts to push Team GO Rocket back, they\u2019re still gaining ground and putting more and more Pok\u00e9mon in danger.",
"quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_1_3", "While Blanche and I continue to investigate, can we depend on you to take down some more Grunts to slow Team GO Rocket down?",
"quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_1_4", "I\u2019m also going to assign you some tasks to test you as a Trainer. Battling Grunts alone won\u2019t keep your skills as sharp as they need to be to continue standing up to Team GO Rocket\u2019s leaders.",
"quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_2_0", "Thanks for taking on those Grunts, %PLAYERNAME%.",
"quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_2_1", "I was working with Candela to figure out what challenges we could give you to help you prepare for battles with other Trainers and in the GO Battle League. Those skills carry over to doing battle with the Team GO Rocket Leaders, after all!",
"quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_2_2", "Candela was very excited to find ways to keep you on your toes!",
"quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_2_3", "Could you take on these challenges as part of your ongoing training?",
"quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_3_0", "You\u2019ve done the team leaders proud, %PLAYERNAME%!",
"quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_3_1", "You took on those challenges like the skilled Trainer you are.",
"quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_3_2", "Great work. Now it\u2019s time to continue the battle against Team GO Rocket.",
"quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_3_3", "Your efforts to rescue and purify Shadow Pok\u00e9mon have certainly not gone unnoticed.",
"quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_3_4", "I\u2019ll be sure to share any new findings about Team GO Rocket\u2019s continued invasion as soon as they crop up, but right now, we should keep up the pressure on the Team GO Rocket Leaders. Good luck, %PLAYERNAME%.",
"quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_4_0", "Taking on the Team GO Rocket Leaders is no easy task. They have proven to be difficult opponents for even the most accomplished Trainers.",
"quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_4_1", "One interesting thing to note is that I\u2019ve heard reports of Trainers rescuing Shiny Shadow Pok\u00e9mon from the Team GO Rocket Leaders.",
"quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_4_2", "This only further supports my suspicions that Team GO Rocket is gathering large numbers of Pok\u00e9mon if they\u2019ve been able to find Shiny ones to turn into Shadow Pok\u00e9mon.",
"quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_4_3", "There is definitely more that we need to learn about these foes and what their plans are.",
"quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_4_4", "For now, I need you to focus. It\u2019s time to take on Giovanni himself. You got this, %PLAYERNAME%.",
"quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_5_0", "What an impressive victory, %PLAYERNAME%!",
"quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_5_1", "Giovanni is one of the toughest opponents out there, but your continued efforts to improve let you rise to the challenge! After this, I\u2019m going to talk with the team leaders to discuss how we can further support you.",
"quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_5_2", "You\u2019ve been an amazing part of the team, and we wouldn\u2019t be able to keep these villains at bay without your skills and dedication.",
"quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_5_3", "But we can\u2019t drop our guard while Team GO Rocket\u2019s around, so keep honing your battle techniques. I suggest challenging your fellow Trainers to battles and testing yourself in the GO Battle League.",
"quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_5_4", "I\u2019ll be in touch again soon, but until then, let\u2019s GO!",
"quest_special_dialogue_spiritomb_0_0", "Oh, %PLAYERNAME%! You\u2019ve dropped by just in time.",
"quest_special_dialogue_spiritomb_0_1", "As I was out on my regular walk one evening, I stumbled upon this odd stone. Something told me to bring it back to my lab for further research, and ever since then, strange things have been happening.",
"quest_special_dialogue_spiritomb_0_2", "Papers shifting around, water glasses tipping all by themselves...",
"quest_special_dialogue_spiritomb_0_3", "When I tried using my computer to research it, I got an error message with the number 108 flashing! %PLAYERNAME%, can you help gather some data on nearby Ghost-type Pok\u00e9mon?",
"quest_special_dialogue_spiritomb_0_4", "I have to believe we can solve these spooky occurrences with science!",
"quest_special_dialogue_spiritomb_1_0", "%PLAYERNAME%, thanks so much for your help. I did some research on Ghost-type Pok\u00e9mon, and I think there\u2019s a Ghost- and Dark-type Pok\u00e9mon that is bound to a strange stone.",
"quest_special_dialogue_spiritomb_1_1", "I can\u2019t say for sure just yet, but it seems this Pok\u00e9mon may actually be composed of 108 spirits bound together. So maybe if we catch 108 Pok\u00e9mon, it will appear?",
"quest_special_dialogue_spiritomb_1_2", "Good luck, %PLAYERNAME%!  And...would you keep the light on in the lab for me? All this spooky research is making my hair stand on end.",
"quest_special_dialogue_spiritomb_2_0", "Wow, %PLAYERNAME%! It seems we\u2019ve had a spooky brush with Spiritomb!",
"quest_special_dialogue_spiritomb_2_1", "I can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s the weather, but I\u2019ve got the shivers! You know, I feel confident that we can solve anything together, %PLAYERNAME%, even when things get scary.",
"quest_special_dialogue_spiritomb_2_2", "I'll be in touch soon!",
"quest_special_dialogue_st_0_0", "Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! You surprised me, much like the Seedot that just fell from that tree over there.",
"quest_special_dialogue_st_0_1", "It really scared a Pidgey that was foraging nearby, and I\u2019m pretty sure it did that on purpose.",
"quest_special_dialogue_st_0_2", "It\u2019s easy for Seedot to trick people and Pok\u00e9mon alike because Seedot are almost indistinguishable from acorns.",
"quest_special_dialogue_st_0_3", "Are they appearing in higher numbers right now, or am I seeing double? Could you help me investigate this nutty situation?",
"quest_special_dialogue_st_1_0", "Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! While you were away, I was just refreshing my memory on Seedot.",
"quest_special_dialogue_st_1_1", "Apparently, it attaches itself to a tree branch using the top of its head and sucks moisture from the tree it\u2019s hanging from. The more water Seedot drinks, the glossier its body becomes.",
"quest_special_dialogue_st_1_2", "Thanks, Seedot, for reminding us to stay hydrated! Did you know that Seedot can evolve? AHHH! Sorry, I was just startled by another one.",
"quest_special_dialogue_st_1_3", "Why don\u2019t you try evolving Seedot? Maybe it\u2019ll get calmer and stop playing pranks on everyone!",
"quest_special_dialogue_st_2_0", "On the one hand, fantastic work, Trainer. Your little Seedot has evolved into Nuzleaf, the Wily Pok\u00e9mon. On the other hand, our plan to calm Seedot down by evolving it has backfired.",
"quest_special_dialogue_st_2_1", "Apparently, Nuzleaf can make a flute out of the leaf on its head, and the sound of that flute strikes fear and uncertainty into the hearts of people who hear it.",
"quest_special_dialogue_st_2_2", "I\u2019m sorry. But I have faith that a brave Trainer like yourself can handle Nuzleaf just fine!",
"quest_special_dialogue_st_2_3", "Maybe if we try evolving it again...its next form will be less scary! Personally, I\u2019ve been startled enough for one day of research!",
"quest_special_dialogue_st_3_0", "So...your Nuzleaf has evolved into Shiftry, the Wicked Pok\u00e9mon. Unfortunately, upon reviewing data on Shiftry, I learned it can be quite fearsome, too.",
"quest_special_dialogue_st_3_1", "Using its leafy fan, Shiftry can create wind gusts with speeds of up to one hundred feet per second. That\u2019s strong enough to level houses! I think I need to go tie my mobile lab down!",
"quest_special_dialogue_st_3_2", "I\u2019d rather be surprised by a Seedot than blown away by a Shiftry! Hah...lesson learned\u2014stay up-to-date with Pok\u00e9mon, even familiar ones!",
"quest_special_dialogue_st_3_3", "Thank you for your help researching this odd occurrence. Once these winds die down, I\u2019ll be in touch about our next research adventure!",
"quest_special_dialogue_tcc_0_0", "Hi there, %PLAYERNAME%. I can\u2019t help but be impressed by your progress. You\u2019ve done fantastic work in researching Pok\u00e9mon originally discovered in the Kanto, Johto, Hoenn, and Sinnoh regions.",
"quest_special_dialogue_tcc_0_1", "Now that we\u2019ve researched Pok\u00e9mon that were found in those regions...",
"quest_special_dialogue_tcc_0_2", "let\u2019s take a closer look at Pok\u00e9mon originally discovered in the Unova region!",
"quest_special_dialogue_tcc_0_3", "I think it\u2019s fascinating that even though we know a lot about Pok\u00e9mon from all over the world, there\u2019s always more to learn!",
"quest_special_dialogue_tcc_0_4", "Speaking of discoveries, I\u2019ve been doing some additional research and heard about an interesting phenomenon that has to do with Meowth in the Galar region.",
"quest_special_dialogue_tcc_0_5", "I was speaking to a researcher who\u2019s the granddaughter of a colleague from Galar, and she shared some intriguing information.",
"quest_special_dialogue_tcc_0_6", "It seems that Galarian Meowth lived with seafaring people, which toughened their bodies so much that parts of them turned to iron.",
"quest_special_dialogue_tcc_0_7", "Maybe I could get a few workout tips\u2014I\u2019ve been looking for some ways to toughen up myself!",
"quest_special_dialogue_tcc_0_8", "Anyway...let\u2019s do some more research on Pok\u00e9mon originally discovered in Unova, but be sure to keep your eyes open for other exciting discoveries.",
"quest_special_dialogue_tcc_1_0", "Wonderful work, Trainer. You might be familiar with the tradition in which a Pok\u00e9mon Trainer selects their very first partner from a group of three Pok\u00e9mon.",
"quest_special_dialogue_tcc_1_1", "These first-partner Pok\u00e9mon are normally Fire, Water, or Grass types. In Unova, many Trainers choose the Water-type Oshawott as their first-partner Pok\u00e9mon.",
"quest_special_dialogue_tcc_1_2", "This Sea Otter Pok\u00e9mon is known to use the scalchop on its stomach during battle. Isn\u2019t that just adorable? Please continue your research, and let me know your findings.",
"quest_special_dialogue_tcc_2_0", "I can\u2019t stop thinking about how cute Oshawott is... Oh! You\u2019re back! Excellent work catching that Darumaka!",
"quest_special_dialogue_tcc_2_1", "Now that we\u2019ve researched the Water-type first-partner Pok\u00e9mon of many Trainers from Unova, let\u2019s shift focus to the Fire-type one\u2014Tepig!",
"quest_special_dialogue_tcc_2_2", "I\u2019m a particular fan of Tepig because it uses the fireballs that come from its nose to roast Berries. It\u2019s such a clever use of a skill.",
"quest_special_dialogue_tcc_2_3", "I just love roasted Pinap Berries! We should continue our work and see what else we can discover.",
"quest_special_dialogue_tcc_3_0", "Being the savvy Trainer you are, I\u2019m sure you know which type of Pok\u00e9mon we\u2019re going to research next.",
"quest_special_dialogue_tcc_3_1", "That\u2019s right\u2014Grass type! In Unova, many Trainers choose the Grass Snake Pok\u00e9mon Snivy as their first partner. Snivy is intelligent and calm, and being exposed to lots of sunlight makes it move more swiftly.",

"quest_special_dialogue_wt_2_0", "Well done with that evolving, %PLAYERNAME%. However, it looks like the evolved form of Weedle, Kakuna, is just...sitting there. I knew this Cocoon Pok\u00e9mon didn\u2019t move much, but wow.",

"quest_special_dialogue_wt_3_1", "Beedrill, the Poison Bee Pok\u00e9mon, is known for being extremely territorial. It sometimes attacks in swarms, and Beedrill nests are very dangerous!",
