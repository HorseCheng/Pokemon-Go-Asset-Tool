Hello again, %PLAYERNAME%! Isn’t this place lovely?
I can’t stop thinking about taking a vacation. I know we’re always outdoors researching, but taking a break and going somewhere new and just relaxing sounds so nice, doesn’t it?
Vacations are even better when you’ve got a Pokémon pal at your side!
In that spirit, why don’t you spend some time exploring the area with your Buddy Pokémon? Let’s see what there is to see!
You know, one of my favorite parts of traveling is trying out local foods. I think my Meltan would agree!
Once, it attempted to absorb a local camper’s mess kit—since, as you know, Meltan dissolves and eats metal. Luckily, I was able to avert that crisis before if got too, er...messy.
Who needs a lid for their curry pot, anyway? Haha...
All this talk of food and the like has my stomach rumbling. I’m sure the local Pokémon would be thankful for some snacks, too. How about you share some Berries with them?
You know, I wonder if my mind’s been so fixated on flying somewhere far away because of all the Flying-type Pokémon in the area today. What do you think, %PLAYERNAME%?
It sure would be nice to glide somewhere on a whim...
With such boundless freedom, why do you think all these Flying-type Pokémon chose to gather here? I know we’re supposed to be on vacation, but would you mind catching some Pokémon to help me understand this phenomenon, %PLAYERNAME%?
Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! Thanks for catching those Pokémon for me. I really appreciate it!
You should go enjoy the sights and make some memories in the area. Maybe even send a postcard or two!
I’d go with you, but I think Meltan’s been nibbling on my research equipment again... We’ve talked about this, Meltan! Scrap metal only, please!
Good to see you! I hope you had a refreshing stroll.
In addition to all the Flying-type Pokémon, there seem to be a lot of unique Pikachu appearing in the area. I saw a few wearing rather stylish shirts and even some flying in the air with balloons!
I can’t say I’ve ever seen Pikachu like this before, but they certainly appear to be enjoying themselves. Let’s spend some time with them before we wrap up!
Thanks again for another great adventure, %PLAYERNAME%. I hope you had as much fun as I did. Now, until next time—let’s GO!

Why do you insist on wasting my time?
You lack the gravitas to be in the presence of Team GO Rocket. I’ll finish this quickly.
Well, if you insist on battling, as a Trainer, I must accept. However, you will pay for inconveniencing me.
You have such an air of arrogance about you. Allow me to dispel it for you.
Your insolence disgusts me. I’ll make sure your confidence is utterly shattered following this battle.
Your sense of self-importance sickens me. Are you prepared to be wholly humiliated?
Your arrogance will be your downfall, and I shall be the one to set that in motion.
Loss is not a concept I’m acquainted with. I don’t expect that will change after this battle.
A person of your stature shouldn’t be this confident. Fret not—I’ll do you the honor of teaching you this lesson.
Usually I wouldn’t consider debasing myself by battling a commoner...but I’ll make an exception to humiliate you.
How...how can this be? I...I never lose!
How dare you...humiliate me like this?
I haven’t felt this much humiliation since I lost my battle with Candela... You’ll pay for this.
The last person to humiliate me like this was Candela. You’ll all pay for this...
I...I don’t understand... I never lose...
Oh? Are you here to challenge me? Don’t test me.
Pokémon are my tools, and winning is my birthright. Get in my way, and you’ll be crushed, vermin.
Are you the best that Candela and her little friends could find?
Tch... How dare riffraff such as yourself speak to me?
Only a fool would challenge me.
Team GO Rocket’s domination is inevitable. Submit and you may be spared.
Pokémon are our tools. We are entitled to power them up as we so choose. Commoners such as yourself would never understand.
My sole purpose in life is to win. I’ll vanquish whoever dares to get in my way.
Oh, do YOU think you can beat me? Someone of your standing? Hah!
What a fool you are to even think of battling me.
Don’t be too disappointed. It was always going to end like this.
I never lose. Now get out of my sight.
If this is the best Candela and her little friends can offer, Team GO Rocket has nothing to worry about.
If the rest of the Trainers of this world are like you, then Team GO Rocket’s success is assured.
It was foolish of you to think you could beat me. It’s because of my brilliance that we have Shadow Pokémon!

It’s time to explore your city with your Buddy Pokémon, %PLAYERNAME%! I’m excited to do the same with my trusty buddy, too.

And even the familiar can hide exciting, new things to discover! Let’s GO and explore together, Trainer.

I won’t let Giovanni down!
You? Defeat me? Not gonna happen.
You’re nothing more than a weak distraction.
I won’t let the boss down.
This’ll be a lesson you won’t soon forget.
This hero thing you’re trying? It’s about to come crashing down on you.
You’re a pest, and I’m gonna give you the boot.
Anyone who gets in my way gets destroyed.
This is for Team GO Rocket.
My loyalty gives me strength. I won’t lose!
You’ll pay for this!
This...this can’t be!
Us Team GO Rocket Leaders will get you next time!
What? But I can’t lose! Boss, I’m so sorry!
This defeat only fuels my anger!
Cliff’s my name. Battling’s my game.
The boss has ordered that we crush all of you, and the boss’s order is above all!
Do you really wanna fight?
What do you want—a battle?
A loser like you can’t beat Team GO Rocket.
You got a lot of nerve for a loser!
Pfft... You wanna fight?
Do you think you can beat me?
Why stop the inevitable? Team GO Rocket will always win!
Why do you fight us? Team GO Rocket gave so many of us a community—a purpose. What’s wrong with that?
Hahaha! What’d I tell ya? Of course I’d win!
Yes! I hope you’re proud of me, Boss.
Heh heh... That’s right. I beat you!
I’d never let the boss down!
That’s right! Team GO Rocket never loses!
That's already your name!

Prepare yourself for a world of pain.
I’d say to prepare for battle, but you have already lost.
Humble yourself. You are facing the world’s greatest Trainer.
If you insist on disrupting my plans, I will insist on making you regret it.
You have no idea who you are challenging, child.
You underestimate Team GO Rocket. Prepare for battle.
There is no stopping my plans.
Two things are inevitable: my success and your failure.
You have proven yourself by reaching me, so I shall spare you a moment of my time.
You may have made it here, but this is as far as you’ll go.
What?! This can’t be!
Your love of Pokémon gave you the advantage...this time.
... ... ...I shall step aside this time!
This defeat is meaningless. Team GO Rocket will never fall!
This isn’t over. We will meet on the battlefield again.
I must say—I am impressed you got here.
What’s this now? I hope you are a worthy opponent.
I am the leader of this enterprise...Giovanni!
Fwahahahaha!
How dare you?! You will pay for your insolence!
Your Pokémon exist for Team GO Rocket’s use.
I commend you for standing up to me, Trainer. I trust you’ll make this worth my time.
You are foolish to confront me, but I’m impressed by your confidence. Let’s battle.
My goal is beyond your comprehension.
If you insist on confronting me, you will pay the price!
You found a Super Rocket Radar!
The Super Rocket Radar is a stronger radar that can find headquarters where the Team GO Rocket Boss might be!
What an amusing Trainer.
As expected, Team GO Rocket cannot be stopped.
You cannot stop my master plan.
Do not try to interfere again.
You failed as soon as you challenged me, Trainer.

Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%. As you know, I do a lot of research. There are just so many Pokémon to learn about and document!
Recently, I’ve been investigating Ralts, the Feeling Pokémon, to learn more about how this Pokémon senses people’s emotions by using the horns on its head.
It’s an amazing ability, don’t you think?
I thought studying this Pokémon’s unique sensing powers could help me identify the strange feeling that’s been stirring inside me these past few weeks.
I’ve realized, though, that this isn’t any ordinary emotion—it’s a type of energy!
This mysterious energy is filling me with hope and determination. I feel like I could take on any challenge and be victorious!
I would appreciate your assistance in collecting more information on this strange and fascinating phenomenon.
Thanks for completing the research we needed to get started, %PLAYERNAME%.
While you were catching Pokémon and visiting PokéStops, I started digging through my research and found references to a phenomenon that seems to have a lot in common with what I’ve been experiencing.
The reports refer to a Mythical Pokémon that shares the infinite energy it creates with others to guarantee victory.
The reports also state that this Pokémon is Psychic- and Fire-type. What an amazing combination!
To get closer to confirming the source of the energy, let’s focus our efforts on catching Pokémon that share those same types.
Wonderful work, %PLAYERNAME%.
Thanks to your efforts researching Psychic- and Fire-type Pokémon, we’re well on our way to confirming the source of this mysterious energy.
There’s many a mystery surrounding our path forward, so I’ll keep poring over our research notes. In the meantime, I’d like you to work on becoming better friends with your Pokémon.
As a Trainer, strengthening the bond between you and your Pokémon is an important task that requires a specific set of skills.
To further develop those skills, why don’t you try spending time with your buddy?
Successful partnerships take work and dedication, and talented Trainers build lifelong friendships with their Pokémon.
That being said, be sure to spend time with your buddy every day!
You have a wonderful bond with your buddy, Trainer! It’s been a treat watching that friendship bloom. Now, though, it’s time to focus our efforts on the matter at hand!
After further examination of the research you completed, I’m convinced that the Pokémon we’re looking for is Victini, the Victory Pokémon.
Not only would this be consistent with the references to a Psychic- and Fire-type Pokémon, but it would also explain the mysterious surge of energy I’ve been experiencing.
It’s time for you to befriend Victini. Since this Pokémon represents victory, I think winning a few battles might inspire it to come forward!
I’ve been hearing reports that Team GO Rocket is causing trouble. Battling these troublemakers just might show this Pokémon you’re worthy of attention!
Let’s see whether some victory will attract the Victory Pokémon!
Absolutely astounding, %PLAYERNAME%! I knew you’d be able to display your powerful bonds and battle prowess to impress the Mythical Pokémon Victini.
It shares the infinite energy it creates when its body overflows with power, so I’m absolutely certain now that the energy I was feeling was coming directly from Victini!
Be sure to use this power wisely, %PLAYERNAME%, as you and Victini take on new challenges. But for now, your hard work calls for a celebration!
Why don’t you take a few snapshots with Victini and share your success with fellow Trainers by sending them some Gifts?
Once again, you have helped me uncover a huge discovery. I cannot thank you enough for your time and dedication.
The world of Pokémon is filled with endless discoveries, and it isn’t every day we come across a Mythical Pokémon!
I hope that you will take the lessons we learned together through this investigation and apply them to your training.
I’m proud of you, %PLAYERNAME%, and hope you continue to strive to be your very best. Until next time, let’s GO!

%PLAYERNAME%! I can’t tell you how much of a relief it is to see you.
The weather’s still going haywire, and we have multiple confirmed sightings of Primal Kyogre and Primal Groudon. I’m afraid they’ve left a streak of destruction in their wake.
But hope is not lost—Rhi and the team leaders are still searching for the Red and Blue Orbs, which are said to have once resolved a similar incident in Hoenn.
Once we have the Orbs, things’ll go back to normal, and—fingers crossed—we’ll be able to figure out what caused this surge of natural energy to begin with.
Rhi left in that direction. If you hurry, you can catch up, %PLAYERNAME%!
A wise choice. If you make use of Incense as we search, we may locate this Pokémon more easily.
Are you already familiar with the Red and Blue Orbs?
Professor Willow informed me they originate from a region called “Hoenn.”
The Orbs have some influence over Primal Reversion. This is the transformation Kyogre and Groudon undergo when they absorb an abundance of natural energy.
A region home to such artifacts must be full of mysteries to illuminate.
Someday, I would like to visit Hoenn and see if any learnings from their myths can be applied to Ultra Beasts.
No matter where one goes, there are always interesting Pokémon that call that place home. Would you not agree—
Ah. I see your chosen Pokémon in that direction. Let us venture after it, %PLAYERNAME%.
It is always a delight to watch you in action, %PLAYERNAME%.
This chase has led us past a diverse array of Pokémon. It could signal that there is something of interest nearby, such as one of the Orbs.
It is also possible that Pokémon are attracted to—not merely attuned to—natural energy. Perhaps we are near one that has undergone Primal Reversion...
But we need not fear. I am confident you and your Pokémon can fend off Primal Kyogre and Primal Groudon. In the meantime, let us review what we know of them.
According to Professor Willow, Groudon has long been described in mythology as the Pokémon that raised lands and expanded continents.
Legends tell of its many clashes against Kyogre, as each sought to gain the power of nature. Could Primal Kyogre and Primal Groudon be fighting once again? That would explain the strange weather.
And speaking of strange, look there—a scarlet glint, coming from that cave. Hm? You cannot see it? Worry not. I shall investigate.
In the meantime, I hear a telltale cry growing nearer. Could it be Primal Groudon?
Thank you for keeping Primal Groudon at bay, %PLAYERNAME%. Here is my contribution—the Red Orb.
The cave I found it in was most impressive. The Red Orb shone with a brilliant crimson light atop something like an altar. Perhaps it was an object of worship in a time long past.
Only the Blue Orb remains. It is associated with Kyogre, if I am not mistaken. 
I have read that Kyogre is able to create massive rain clouds that cover the entire sky and bring about torrential downpours. It has appeared in mythology as the creator of the sea.
The sea... The way sunlight glitters upon the waters of this world is enchanting. The sights where I am from are utterly unalike—though I would still enjoy bringing you to visit someday, %PLAYERNAME%.
But enough talk. I can hear Primal Kyogre nearby. If I could trouble you to keep it at bay, I will continue to canvass the area.
Resplendent work, %PLAYERNAME%.
While you were away, I followed the path of the rain’s runoff. It led me to another mysterious cavern, this time filled with an azure light. The Blue Orb was atop a shining altar. I wish we could have beheld it together.
Now, with both Orbs in our possession, Primal Kyogre and Primal Groudon will cease their rampage.
Climatic conditions should soon stabilize, and natural forces will once again find harmony.
Thank you for your assistance today. I would not have been able to recover the Orbs without the protection provided by you and your Pokémon.
Before we return to Professor Willow, I have one more favor to ask of you.
All our talk of Kyogre and Groudon’s might has sparked my curiosity.
Now that we can safely observe Primal Reversion with the Orbs in our possession, could you give me a demonstration of the phenomenon, %PLAYERNAME%?
%PLAYERNAME%! There you are. The weather’s finally stopped going topsy-turvy! I take that to mean you and Rhi were successful in finding the Red and Blue Orbs.
You two are amazing. Normally, it’d take no less than Rayquaza descending to the ground to settle one of Kyogre and Groudon’s “arguments”!
Maybe you got the jump on it. Rayquaza would have to be mighty speedy to get ahead of you two!
Oh, that reminds me. While you and Rhi were off saving the day, I had some time to think about what could’ve caused the surge of natural energy to begin with. My top theory so far is—
Hold on! Did you see that, %PLAYERNAME%?! Something bright just flew across the sky—could it be a Pokémon?
Looks like we’ve still got some investigating to do!
You know where to find me when you’re ready to continue your Pokémon journey. Until then, thanks again for your help. Things just wouldn’t be the same without you around!
Greetings, %PLAYERNAME%. 
It has been some time since our last mission together. I would not have been able to learn of this world and keep the Ultra Beasts at bay without your previous assistance.
You are here to assist in finding the Red and Blue Orbs, correct? Your company is most welcome, despite these dire circumstances.
I hypothesize that following a Pokémon will lead us in the right direction. Pokémon seem to be well attuned to natural energy.
Please select a Pokémon, %PLAYERNAME%.

%PLAYERNAME%! Boy, am I glad to see you out here.
We’ve got something of a unique situation on our hands.
With nature’s forces out of balance, Primal Kyogre and Primal Groudon have awakened, and they’re wreaking havoc in the surrounding area.
It’s no exaggeration to say the entire world is in peril. The team leaders and Rhi are busy tackling the situation on another front, so some...unlikely allies have offered their support.
I know what I’m about to say is mind-boggling, but Team GO Rocket has offered to work with us to keep Primal Kyogre and Primal Groudon in check.
I never thought I’d see the day. I guess the blustering weather has made even Team GO Rocket’s disposition turn sunny!
Will you meet with them, %PLAYERNAME%? Not only do I have every confidence in your ability to quell Primal Kyogre and Primal Groudon, but I know you’ll be able to stop Team GO Rocket if they try any underhanded tricks.
Now hurry—there’s no time to lose!
Hmph.
I can’t believe I’m being forced to work with one of Candela’s friends. Unbelievable. As if I need help. 
But even I know better than to disobey Giovanni, so there’s no worming my way out of this one.
Just be grateful I’m giving you my time. For the record, I’m more than capable of handling this alone.
In fact, I’ve already come up with a plan to restrain Primal Kyogre and Primal Groudon. All that’s left for you to do is follow my orders.
First, we’re going to inspect the locations where Primal Kyogre and Primal Groudon have appeared. I’m putting you in charge of recording any anomalies you see in the area. 
Well? You heard me, did you not? Time to go.
FINALLY. You’ve got some nerve, showing up late. I’ve been waiting an entire 45 seconds!
Thought you’d be better at this teamwork business, considering how much time you spend yakking with Professor Willow and that kid with the funky goggles.
Don’t waste our time apologizing. And don’t bother introducing yourself. We’ve met enough times to skip the pleasantries.
Let’s get down to business. Our bosses want us to check out a few locations where Primal Kyogre and Primal Groudon have appeared. 
Huh? What do you mean, Professor Willow’s not your boss? Whatever. You got the gist.
Time to get moving. Less talking, more walking!
Well, well! Isn’t this a lovely surprise? We’re on the same side for once!
Don’t look so concerned. There’s nothing in it for me if the world sinks, shakes, or whatever it is we’re supposed to be worried about. 
%PLAYERNAME%, darling, you can trust me.
Not that you have many options right now—especially with your esteemed team leaders and the little begoggled one otherwise occupied.
Collaborating will be a new experience for me, too. So let’s find the silver lining of this debacle and learn from one another, shall we? 
First, you and your Pokémon will accompany me to a few locations where Primal Kyogre and Primal Groudon have appeared.
Come along. Let’s see what you’re made of. 
I’ll acknowledge you have some skill with a camera.
*sigh* Thank you, whatever your name was. This’ll do.
Now I have enough information to move on with my investigation of Primal Reversion.
You look confused. Did that professor of yours never teach you about Primal Reversion? 
I bet you’re thinking that if Candela were here, she could explain it. Unfortunately for you, I’m your leader for today.
Hmph... Fine. I’ll humor you with an explanation, if only to prove that I know more than both Candela and your professor about the subject.
Primal Reversion is a phenomenon where Kyogre and Groudon can transform when they absorb massive amounts of energy from nature. It’s similar to Mega Evolution, and it grants them incredible power and strength. You follow?
Did you just...thank me? Er. Gratitude won’t get you anywhere, you know.
I’ll admit I’m not hating this alliance as much as I’d expected... But don’t push your luck.
Huh. These are decent snapshots.
What do I need ’em for? Hah! That’s the smartest question you’ve asked all day.
These’ll help us understand Primal Reversion—the phenomenon where Kyogre and Groudon return to their primal forms. I’ve heard Arlo say it’s kind of like Mega Evolution, but powered by nature’s energy.
Now you can go give Primal Kyogre and Primal Groudon the smackdown.
What’s that? Of course I’m coming with you. We’re a team today.
“Can’t leave a partner out to dry.” That’s what we used to say back on the ranch.
Didn’t know I had a ranch? Guess you wouldn’t. Those days are long gone, anyhow.
OK, enough chitchat. You and your Pokémon are gonna lead the way, “partner.”
You’ve kept up so far. Now show me you’ve got what it takes!
These snapshots could’ve been dreadful, but they’re actually decent! Color me mildly impressed.
They’d be better without your Pokémon in the way. All the same, these will help us better understand Primal Reversion.
Primal Reversion? You know, the phenomenon where Kyogre and Groudon can transform when they absorb massive amounts of energy from nature. It’s quite similar to Mega Evolution, but powered by a different source.
There, you see? Take that tidbit as a token of my appreciation for your assistance. Perhaps working with others does have its merits.
For our next move, let’s see how helpful these observations are in facing the power of Primal Reversion directly.
I believe I hear a telltale cry coming from that direction. Take your Pokémon and challenge them for me, would you? 
%PLAYERNAME%! The strange weather seems to have subsided a little. Your attempts to calm Primal Kyogre and Primal Groudon are clearly paying off. Great work!
I take it your partnership with Team GO Rocket is going well.
It goes to show we can always find new friends, even in precarious times. But before I let you get back to it... Well. Keep your guard up.
I don’t feel good taking Team GO Rocket’s newfound helpfulness with such a large spoonful of skepticism, but I can’t forget their past deeds so easily.
Until they give us cause for concern, though, I’m thankful for their help.
But remember that even though you’ve gathered some research material—great snapshots, by the way—we haven’t managed to quell Primal Kyogre and Primal Groudon for good.
I’m off to check if Rhi and the team leaders have made any progress toward locating the Red and Blue Orbs. Keep at it, %PLAYERNAME%!
Acceptable work. You’ve actually managed to calm Primal Kyogre and Primal Groudon.
And what do you have there? Let me see it.
This looks similar to Mega Energy. Could it be...nature’s energy distilled?
...
Interesting. Fascinating, even. Now I have what I need. With this new power source, Team GO Rocket—no, I, Arlo—will be able to control the very shape of the earth.
But even without that power, there’s one thing I can rid myself of right now.
You. Farewell, friend of Candela. This alliance is over.
You’ve calmed Primal Kyogre and Primal Groudon a few times now.
Not bad! I’d promote you if you were on my team. I know good work when I see it.
In fact, I’m getting the hang of it by watching you. 
Which means Team GO Rocket’s got no more use for you! 
So long, “partner”! 
Don’t tell me you thought we were all best buds now? Pfft... Hahaha!
Nothing will shake my loyalty to Team GO Rocket. And don’t you forget it!
Truly impressive! You’ve managed to calm Primal Kyogre and Primal Groudon more than once now.
Watching you and your Pokémon in action has been a joy. I’ve learned ever so much.
In fact, I’ve learned enough that Team GO Rocket no longer needs you to be part of this operation!
Oh, but where are my manners? I must thank you for showing us exactly how to take down Kyogre and Groudon.
Rest secure in the knowledge that you’ve contributed to the glory of Team GO Rocket.
You didn’t think this would last forever, did you? Oh, darling. Our alliance ends now.
Solitude is best, after all...
%PLAYERNAME%! What just happened? I saw the Team GO Rocket leaders running off in a huff! And your Pokémon look like they’ve been through the wringer!
*sigh* Let me guess. They tried to pull a fast one on us, didn’t they?
Not very smart of them to go toe-to-toe with you. I assume you taught them a lesson before they could complete their scheme. Tell me all about what happened.
... ... ...They made your Pokémon fight alone against Primal Kyogre and Primal Groudon? And they were trying to harness the power of Primal Reversion for themselves?
Thank goodness you didn’t let that power fall into Team GO Rocket’s hands. If they’d gained the ability to reshape the world, who knows what they would’ve done?
Even with that disaster averted, Primal Kyogre and Primal Groudon are no closer to calming down. We’ll have to rely on the team leaders and Rhi to find the Red and Blue Orbs so we can resolve the situation for good.
All the same, I don’t want to understate what you’ve done here, %PLAYERNAME%! Working with Team GO Rocket must have made for one uneasy alliance.
You have my thanks for a job well done. I’m sure I’ll be seeing you again soon.(But...where did all this natural energy come from in the first place?)
Tch... Don’t think for a second that you’ve seen the last of me.
Argh! The boss will be steamed when he hears about this...
Looks like you had one more lesson to teach me. For shame, Sierra... I won’t make this mistake again.

Welcome to Pokémon GO Fest 2020, %PLAYERNAME%! GO Fest this year is a little bit different from previous years, but it’ll be just as fun—and challenging!
I’ve noticed an amazing phenomenon—it seems as though different Pokémon are appearing in the area on what seems an hourly basis. I need your help collecting data on this situation.
We’ll have another fun-filled day tomorrow. For now, I’m going to start looking into this situation. Perhaps it’s related to a powerful Pokémon.
Now, %PLAYERNAME%, I’m sure you know what I’m going to say next.
Let’s GO!
I thought it would be fun to give you some tasks to help you research this phenomenon. I’ll make sure you get a reward for your hard work!
Don’t delay—since different Pokémon seem to be appearing each hour, you have limited time to complete these tasks! You can see Trainers’ progress by checking the Global Challenge Arena.
To help with your research, be sure to use Incense to attract Pokémon.
Remember, you can now activate several Incense at once and have them attract Pokémon to you for hours! Incense smells amazing, doesn’t it?
It brings a smile to my face knowing that millions of Trainers around the world are working together right now because of their shared love of Pokémon.
Furthermore, I’ve been sensing a great energy that has filled me with hope and determination. Have you been feeling it as well?
I wonder whether it’s connected to the strange happenings that kicked off our research this weekend.
I have a feeling today’s just the beginning of an exciting adventure!
GO Fest 2020: Welcome!
GO Fest 2020: Welcome! (1/1)
%PLAYERNAME%, by the look on your face, I’m sure you’ve grasped the situation.
Team GO Rocket confetti is raining down from the sky. Grunts are invading PokéStops all around the world. And...Team GO Rocket has taken over Pokémon GO Fest.
We thought we put a stop to them when we ended their take-over during our research leading up to GO Fest.
But that take-over appears to have been only part of a larger plan. We have yet to determine Team GO Rocket’s ultimate goal, though. Regardless of what it is, %PLAYERNAME%...you must prepare yourself.
I’m impressed by your energy and that of your fellow Trainers around the world! If we work together, I know victory is within our reach!
Great work, %PLAYERNAME%. Your Pokémon are ready for battle, and I bet your fellow Trainers are thankful for the supplies you’ve sent their way. We’ll need to work together to keep Team GO Rocket at bay and save Pokémon GO Fest!
Oh, what’s this? Looks like the snapshots you took feature some unwelcome guests! It’s amazing that Team GO Rocket can organize these massive take-overs, but its members do seem a little silly.
Or maybe these photobombs are actually all a part of their scheme? Anyway, why don’t you put all your training to use? In the meantime, I’ll do some more investigating with the team leaders.
Thanks to your hard work, you’ve caught a Golem!
The team leaders and I have been scoping out the Team GO Rocket balloons and have discovered that the Team GO Rocket Leaders are using Flying-type Pokémon.
Sources told me that Team GO Rocket might’ve captured some Legendary Pokémon and turned them into Shadow Pokémon, too!
If I recall correctly, the team leaders saw one of these balloons at GO Fest last year—and another during the Team GO Rocket take-over a few weeks ago.
I wouldn’t have imagined that Team GO Rocket would spend resources on such an...interesting means of transportation. However, it’s clear that the boss has put a lot of effort into providing his Grunts with balloons.
Your Golem might be a helpful addition to your battle party, since Flying types are weak to Rock-type attacks! %PLAYERNAME%, it’s time to rock Team GO Rocket’s world and save those Legendary Shadow Pokémon!
Great job defeating Sierra, Cliff, and Arlo. Now all that’s left is their boss, Giovanni. %PLAYERNAME%, are you ready?
Spark, Blanche, and Candela can handle the Team GO Rocket Leaders while you prepare to face the boss. It’s interesting that the Team GO Rocket Leaders are commanding these Legendary Shadow Pokémon, which are usually reserved for the boss himself.
Perhaps we’ll learn what this means as we uncover Team GO Rocket’s devious plans and discover what Pokémon Giovanni now has under his control.
On the bright side, I received an encouraging message from the team leaders about a mysterious phenomenon. Remember that powerful energy I detected yesterday?
The team leaders reported that Trainers worldwide suddenly felt a similar energy that filled them with hope and determination. Through my research, I found references to that very same energy.
They document a Mythical Pokémon that shares its infinite energy with others and guarantees a winning battle. I have a feeling that’s why Team GO Rocket is here.
Perhaps Team GO Rocket hopes to further its dastardly plans by using this powerful Pokémon?
I hear Giovanni often begins his battles with his Buddy Pokémon, Persian, which is weak to Fighting-type attacks. The Machamp you caught earlier might help you here.
Good luck, %PLAYERNAME%. The fate of Pokémon GO Fest is in your hands.
%PLAYERNAME%, you did it! You defeated Giovanni and sent him packing! Who would’ve thought that he could turn even Mewtwo into a Shadow Pokémon? That alone is a mystery we need to investigate.
It was a tough battle, and the fact that you defeated Mewtwo proves what an amazing Trainer you are.
Spark, Blanche, and Candela were victorious against the Team GO Rocket Leaders and drove them away, too.
Thanks to everyone’s efforts, we’ve saved Pokémon GO Fest! It’s time to celebrate!
Turns out, Team GO Rocket was after Victini, the Victory Pokémon! Some say this Pokémon brings victory to its Trainer, regardless of the contest.
I’m now sure that the energy we were all feeling was thanks to Victini. I’m in utter awe of your tenacity and determination. Pokémon GO Fest was saved because of your hard work. Thank you, %PLAYERNAME%.
Phew! Now, I think we should get back to having fun. There’s still time to enjoy the festivities!
While this year’s GO Fest was quite a bit different from previous ones, I’m overjoyed that Trainers all over the world could still come together to celebrate—and protect—our beloved Pokémon.
Even when we’re apart, we’re still united by our love of Pokémon. No matter what obstacles appear in your path, you can always count on your Pokémon and your fellow Trainers.
I know we’ll all meet again under the same sky someday, so until then...let’s GO!

Welcome to Pokémon GO Fest 2021!
Pokémon GO Fest 2022
It is beautiful here. Dazzlingly so...
Perhaps we should patrol the area to familiarize ourselves with its geography and identify any emerging irregularities.
I have also not forgotten about your missing professor.
Others have also expressed distress over his absence—specifically, a fiery woman with short brown hair.
She hypothesized that participating in Pokémon battles could shed some light on your companion’s whereabouts. As for how, I cannot say... But I trust her expertise on the matter.
Come, Pokémon Trainer. Let us begin our patrol.
Ah. You have once again caught me in a moment of reverie, Pokémon Trainer.
I lost myself in the atmosphere around us.
I notice your fellows are gathering en masse.
Am I to understand this is typical for the Pokémon Trainers of your world?
So it is a festival. I see.
And since you are present, I assume you mean to participate.
Do enjoy, then. But I would caution you to stay alert.
If an Ultra Beast were to appear amid such a gathering, chaos would ensue.
This place has drawn a remarkable number of Pokémon—an astounding example of regional biodiversity.
After you, Pokémon Trainer.
One even attempted to approach me. Your world’s Pokémon offer friendship so effortlessly.
If only the Ultra Beasts were as amiable...
A shame. Moving on—you mentioned that you and Willow were pursuing the Pokémon Shaymin before his disappearance, correct?
I recently overheard another Pokémon Trainer say that “upon taking in the scent of a particular rare flower, Shaymin is enveloped in light, and its tiny body transforms.”
An irradiant image. I wonder if this transformation is akin to Evolution or if it is something else entirely.
In a less eventful time, I would study Shaymin to see such a shine for myself.
But I must temper my enthusiasm. An Ultra Wormhole could appear at any moment.
We should continue our patrol.
Pokémon Trainer. Nihilego is no longer this world’s sole Ultra Beast.
I have just observed UB-02 Beauty—Pheromosa, to some humans—emerge from a freshly formed Ultra Wormhole.
Although it is a common organism in the world it calls home, it is a danger here.
It must not be allowed to wreak havoc.
Luckily, you and I have a history of contending with such situations.
Just be warned that this Ultra Beast is not easily subdued.
That is why I have prepared some Beast Balls for you.
They are a type of ball specifically designed to capture Ultra Beasts. I hope they prove useful.
Now, if you will attend to catching Pheromosa, I will focus on reconnaissance. Let us go, Pokémon Trainer.
You impress me yet again, Pokémon Trainer.
If you take snapshots of the unique locations in this area, we can scrutinize them together.
The ease with which you handle Ultra Beasts is enviable. It is a technique unfamiliar to me, and yet it comes to you naturally.
Even in the face of immense danger, I might add.
I am endlessly fascinated by you.
... ... ...
While you battled, I had a thought.
Your photographic observations—can they be used in other ways, perhaps?
For example: if you were to take snapshots of the surrounding areas, do you think that might help us identify anomalies we’d otherwise miss if we relied only on our eyes?
It is “worth a shoot,” at any rate.
Thank you for your diligence, Pokémon Trainer. I will take your snapshots for further study.
We will surely find him. I will prioritize the study of your snapshots and conduct further reconnaissance on my own time—it is the least I can do in return for all that you have done for me.
Until I uncover a clue, let us turn our attention back to the subject of food.
Would it benefit us to feed Pheromosa, I wonder?
Perhaps the positive properties of this world’s Poffins affect Ultra Beasts as well.
However, Pheromosa seems reticent to engage—almost as if this world disagrees with its notion of cleanliness.
An experiment, then: let us place a Poffin on the ground so we may observe its reaction.
From a distance.
What is that in your other hand—a Poffin? Are you hungry?
Hm. We have been walking for a while.
Let us rest, then.
Perhaps your Pokémon is also in need of nourishment.
And while we are on the subject: what distinguishes Pokémon food from human food?
Your professor would have such answers? I should have known—his juice-stained coat speaks of an affinity for Berries.
Do you think he—
Apologies. It was tactless of me to speak of Willow when you are anxious about his safety.
What an oddly enjoyable endeavor, Pokémon Trainer.
The more we learn, the less there is to fear.
I suspect Willow feels much the sa—
Wait. Another anomaly is approaching. It almost resembles the description you gave of the Pokémon Shaymin, and yet with marked differences...
Your Pokémon are lucky to have such a reliable guardian.
I’m sure they are grateful. As am I.
This entire situation would have been troublesome for me to handle alone.
Our time together has taught me much.
While you were tending to your Pokémon, I detected a promising signal from within Ultra Space.
It is not much, but I believe it is connected to your professor.
I hope this provides you with some degree of solace.
Knowledge is the great illuminator.
So, I have seen Shaymin and its transformative light.
But enough talk. The light of your festival beckons.
Thank you for sharing this experience with me today.
Until again, Pokémon Trainer.
And from within this light emerges another form.
What a resplendent revelation.
You said Shaymin is drawn to gratitude. Do you believe it was my own such feelings that brought it here?
I am flattered it deemed me worthy.
And I hope I may continue to be a worthy companion to you as well.
With UB-02 Beauty safely in your care and no other Ultra Beasts emerging, I will release you to partake in your festivities.
Meanwhile, I will resume my investigation into Willow’s whereabouts.
There is yet more to do.
Pokémon GO Fest 2022: City habitat
Catch these Pokémon during the City habitat hour!
Post snapshots using #PokemonGOFest2022, and we’ll share our favorites from past and present events!
Pokémon Trainer! I have a positive update to share.
After analyzing the data we collected from the Ultra Wormholes, I have located—and retrieved—Professor Willow from Ultra Space.
His return would not have been possible without your exhaustive efforts.
I do not doubt you are eager to speak with him, but he requires rest before your reunion.
Following that, I would appreciate your assistance with another matter.
UB-01 Symbiont and UB-02 Beauty—that is, Nihilego and Pheromosa—have once again returned to this world.
I need not emphasize what dangers they pose.
Additionally, new signals indicate that other Ultra Beasts may soon follow.
But first, your professor. You and I can reconvene after you two have spoken.
... ... ...%PLAYERNAME%? Is...that you?How long has it been? It’s good to see you. I’ve had the most amazing adventure!
There I was, pondering the mysteries of the island guardians—and moping a little at my misfortune, I must admit—when a glowing portal appeared out of thin air!
I couldn’t help wondering what was on the other side. My curiosity ignited, I weighed the risks, grabbed my gear, and jumped right in!
The portal led to a completely different dimension—one traversed by unimaginably strange creatures...
I must tell you all about it! *yawn* But before I do, I could use a little nap. I promise I’ll spare no detail after I’ve slept...a few...*snore*
Welcome back, Pokémon Trainer. I hope you had a pleasant reunion with your professor. Has he fallen asleep? Understandable.
You and I can turn our attention to the Ultra Beasts while he recuperates.
I have confirmed the reappearance of UB-02 Absorption, Buzzwole.
Buzzwole’s propensity for displaying its robust musculature remains a mystery—is it mere self-satisfaction or some kind of threat?
Its sturdy physique stands in contrast to Pheromosa’s lithe frame.
Though neither should be underestimated.
Since we cannot predict their behavior, I propose further observation. Have you all your necessary supplies?
If you and your Pokémon are ready, then we can begin.

Specifically, an individual with long white hair.
It was mentioned that applied research could shed some light on your professor’s whereabouts.
As for how, I cannot say... But I trust that person’s expertise on the matter.
My data indicates that the Ultra Beast most likely to appear is UB-03 Lighting.
Some humans call it Xurkitree. They stand unmoving with their limbs stuck into the ground.
It must not be allowed to wreak havoc.
Be warned that this Ultra Beast is not easily subdued.
That is why I have prepared some Beast Balls for you.
The ease with which you handled Xurkitree is enviable. It is a technique unfamiliar to me, and yet it comes to you naturally.
I detected an odd signal when Xurkitree emerged from the Ultra Wormhole.
I have seen—let me consult my notes—Galarian Ponyta, Lapras, Makuhita, and Litwick...
Good night, Pokémon Trainer. No—is it good morning now?
Others have also expressed distress over his absence.
Specifically, a man with spiked hair and an apparent affection for the color yellow.
He has been conducting reconnaissance and seeking clues to your professor’s whereabouts by speaking to Pokémon Trainers assembled at raids.
Perhaps we can also venture to Gyms as we attempt to locate the Ultra Wormhole. Those gathered may help direct our search.
Let us go, Pokémon Trainer.
Temporal expressions aside, I am struck by our surroundings.
This is quite a bustling place.
Which makes my recent readings all the more distressing. I have detected signals that indicate the inevitable appearance of an Ultra Wormhole.
We must locate it and prepare for the emergence of another Ultra Beast.
Let us survey the city.
I have also not forgotten about your missing professor.
How brightly glass glistens when touched by the sun...
Apologies. Even the mundane becomes novel in this abundant light.
But I digress. Have you seen any additional anomalies on your patrol?
In an area this large, I cannot pinpoint the exact location from which an Ultra Wormhole will originate.
We can only rely on our own visual surveillance.
I wonder if the items provided by your PokéStops might help us prepare for the Ultra Wormhole’s impending arrival.
It would befit us to gather as much aid as possible.
Pokémon Trainer. Indulge me in a moment of introspection.
To me, the humans here are exceedingly fortunate.
Even with all our technology, my home is not at all like this.
A world of darkness...
Yet here, light spills from the smallest things—such as your Incubators and their Eggs.
If you can forgive another imposition, will you show me the effect of an Incubator once again?
I wish to see its light.
Thank you, Pokémon Trainer.
Pokémon Trainer. I have located the Ultra Wormhole.
 I hope they prove useful.
The appearance of an Ultra Beast is imminent.
Fortunately, you and I have a history of contending with such situations.
My data indicates that the Ultra Beast most likely to appear is UB-02 Absorption.
Some humans call it Buzzwole. It seems to enjoy displaying its robust musculature.
It must not be allowed to wreak havoc.
Be warned that this Ultra Beast is not easily subdued.
That is why I have prepared some Beast Balls for you.
They are a type of ball specifically designed to capture Ultra Beasts.
You impress me yet again, Pokémon Trainer.
Until that time, I release you to your festivities. The light of your celebration beckons.
Until again, Pokémon Trainer.
The ease with which you handled Buzzwole is enviable. It is a technique unfamiliar to me, and yet it comes to you naturally.
Now, I have an update to share.
I detected an odd signal when Buzzwole emerged from the Ultra Wormhole.
Using it, I can better investigate where within Ultra Space your Professor Willow may be.
I will continue to do what I can to expedite his recovery.
Pokémon Trainer. Good...morning? Or is it the evening?
Perhaps we should both patrol the area to familiarize ourselves with its geography and identify any emerging irregularities.
Come, Pokémon Trainer. Let us begin.
I am still growing accustomed to the cycles of this world.
But enough about time—let us focus on space. Prior to your arrival, I was surveying the area for Ultra Wormholes.
Though I find myself getting lost in the atmosphere around us.
Trainers are gathering here en masse...
Ah. So it’s a festival to celebrate the Pokémon Trainers of this world.
And since you are present, I assume you mean to participate.
Do enjoy, then. But I would caution you to stay alert.
If an Ultra Beast were to appear amid such a gathering, chaos would ensue.
It is beautiful here. Dazzlingly so...
Ah. You have once again caught me in a moment of reverie, Pokémon Trainer.
I am continually struck by the radiance of this world.
Back home—it is dark.
You and your fellows are fortunate.
... ... ...
We should continue our patrol. After you, Pokémon Trainer.
This place has drawn a remarkable number of Pokémon—an astounding example of regional biodiversity.
One even attempted to approach me. Your world’s Pokémon offer friendship so effortlessly. If only the Ultra Beasts were as amiable.
I have seen—let me consult my notes—Lapras, Skorupi, Litwick, Rufflet...
Even my idle time has been illuminating. I discovered that Litwick shines a light that absorbs the life energy of people and Pokémon.
I noted this phenomenon from a distance.
Another benefit of your photographic observations. What else can be safely documented through them?
Taking snapshots of the unique locations in this area might answer this. It is “worth a shoot,” at any rate.
Pokémon Trainer, you mentioned that you and Willow were pursuing the Pokémon Shaymin before his disappearance, correct?
I recently overheard another Pokémon Trainer say that “upon taking in the scent of a particular rare flower, Shaymin is enveloped in light, and its tiny body transforms.”
An irradiant image.
I wonder if this transformation is akin to Evolution or if it is something else entirely.
There is so much I do not know about Pokémon, and yet you gift your knowledge to me freely.
Our time together has taught me much, and for that, I—
Wait. An anomaly is approaching. It almost resembles the description you gave of the Pokémon Shaymin, and yet with marked differences...
So, I have seen Shaymin and its transformative light.
And from within this light emerges another form.
What a resplendent revelation.
You said Shaymin is drawn to gratitude. Do you believe it was my own such feelings that brought it here?
I am pleased that it recognizes my appreciation.
And I hope that appreciation is apparent to you as well.
With no proximate threat, you should return to your festival. I will keep watch.

A brilliant display, Pokémon Trainer. Before we continue, I have something for you.
Here—a small supply of Beast Balls.
Excuse me if I am repeating myself, but allow me a brief explanation.
Beast Balls were developed specifically to capture Ultra Beasts. Your assistance enabled me to fabricate them—I wish to help you as you have helped me.
I trust you will know the right time to use them. Now, let us continue our work.
Pokémon Trainer—I feel we are being watched. Could it be Team GO Rocket?
If they have been observing us, then do you believe they have plans that involve the Ultra Beasts?
This is a possibility we cannot ignore.
If only I could battle like you do... Until then, I must ask again for your aid.
Thank you for dispersing Team GO Rocket, Pokémon Trainer.
I am relieved to know that they have been removed from the equation.
Your strength is further appreciated given this world’s most recent arrival—UB-03 Lighting. Xurkitree.
It has been known to raid power plants, presumably to energize itself with electricity.
It would be disastrous if Xurkitree depleted the power in this area.
Let us do what we can to prevent this catastrophe.
*yawn*Oh, %PLAYERNAME%. Sorry I dozed off on you there—I hardly slept while I was away. Did anything interesting happen while I was gone?
You and your Pokémon should go check it out. I’ll be here. Just give me a...minute...*snore*
... ... ...Ultra Wormholes?Ultra Beasts?BEAST BALLS?!
Incredible! I can always count on you to unearth amazing things. You even helped bring me home!
In that space, there were times when my memories would blur together—but I swear I could feel the light of our world, and everything would rush back.
No, it was more than a feeling. It was like I was surrounded by a protective presence—warm like the sun and calm like the moon.
Even so, I don’t know how I would have returned if you and your new friend hadn’t intervened.
I’m always thankful for you, but this time, you really saved me.
Why, I could just hug you, %PLAYERNAME%!
Wait. Is there something in the sky? I’d investigate myself, but... *yawn* I suddenly feel like I lost a staring contest with a Hypno.
Pokémon Trainer, I saw you were able to speak with the professor. Is he in good health?
He felt something akin to light of the sun and moon, did he?
Interesting.
The important thing is that you and your Willow have been reunited. Endless musing is my proclivity, not yours.
Before we redirect our attention to the Ultra Beasts, I wish to take this opportunity to express what an excellent...erm...
I had intended to call you my “research partner,” but that feels insufficient. You are more than an assistant—you are my confidant.
Such a sterile title hardly suits a person as dazzling as you.
So thank you, %PLAYERNAME%.My partner...and my friend.
I look forward to whatever adventures await us next.
We’ve taken over your celebration, and you still insist on challenging me? Get ready to face the harsh reality.
Your festival is in the hands of Team GO Rocket now. You cannot defeat us.
I’ll defeat you quickly so I can return to the take-over festivities.
I was supposed to win! Everything went perfectly for our take-over!
This take-over was supposed to be my biggest event of the year. How dare you humiliate me like this!
This confetti now just reminds me of my failure. This won’t be the last you see of me...
Today, this event. Tomorrow, the world!
Now that we’ve taken over your little celebration, I bet Candela is worried. Good.
Seeing this confetti rain down and all my hard work pay off... It reignites my passion to defeat you!
Look at me—I want to take a picture of this moment so I can revel in your disappointment later.
If only Candela could see me now. We’ve taken over your celebration, and now I’ve defeated you!
Isn’t this confetti beautiful?
I bet the boss is so proud of us for taking over this event! Don’t take this from us—I need this.
We’ve already taken over this event—now it’s time for the muscle to take you down!
Let’s finish this quick so I can join the other leaders and celebrate the take-over!
NO! We can’t lose our Team GO Rocket festival—we’ve come so far!
What just happened? Are we going to lose the event?
I can’t believe I failed the team.
Enjoying your little festival? Well, it’s a Team GO Rocket festival now!
Hahaha! I’m in a good mood today. This event is ours!
Team GO Rocket has come so far. We’ve finally taken over your big celebration!
Hahaha, what a great battle! Happy Team GO Rocket festival! Time to celebrate with my Grunts!
First we take over this big event, and now I win a battle? Best day ever!
Winning a battle is a great feeling. It’s even better after a take-over!
I do not think you are prepared for the level of failure you are about to experience!
You should be afraid to battle me, especially since you are already too late to stop my take-over!
You will regret trying to put a dent in my perfectly executed take-over. Your Pokémon will be mine!
This is not the end. I will have my revenge.
This festival will be mine one day. You will see—this is not over.
You have only delayed the inevitable. I will win.
I’m surprised you’ve been this successful, considering the foolish guidance your pathetic professor has given you.
I’m impressed that you got by my leaders, Trainer, but nothing will prepare you for my Shadow Pokémon!
At first, I was impressed by your dedication, but now you’ve become a nuisance. This festival is mine.
I hope you now understand how foolish challenging me was. You will never stop Team GO Rocket.
My incredible plan is going swimmingly. Move aside—this event is mine.
As expected. Run back to your professor—you still have much training to do.
Sure glad I got over that fear of heights... Oh, wait... What?
I’ve always wanted to see this event from the air! What a view!
Where do you think the boss got all these balloons?
Talk about getting the high ground! Eh? Eh?
I know I talked about moving up in the organization...but I didn’t think that would mean flying in a balloon...
Do you think there are any of those Pikachu visors left? I’d like to get one as a souvenir of the take-over.
Caw, caw... Worst event ever...
Get in a balloon, they said. It’ll be fun, they said. This is the worst event ever...
This confetti just makes me sad now. Worst event ever.
Caw, CAW! We’ve already taken the skies, and now we’ve taken your precious event, too!
Team GO Rocket’s balloon squad, reporting for duty! We’ve taken over this festival!
Wow! The confetti looks great from up here!
Today, this celebration. Tomorrow, the world!
I know you hate to see us take over your festival but love to watch us fly away.
Can’t wait to fly around in my handy-dandy hot-air balloon and defeat other event attendees!
I didn’t even need to be here for this take-over. Just to make it worth my time, let’s battle.
I know I’ll be disappointed in your battling, so let’s just get this over with.
Might as well pass the time with a battle, considering your little event is ruined.
This must be a mistake. Failure isn’t an option.
You must have some kind of special power on your side that made you win. That’s the only explanation...
I can’t believe I lost to such an unworthy opponent! You’ll pay for disrupting our plans!
It’s almost silly that I’m here, considering we already took over this event.
Aww, you think the confetti is for you... Sorry, darling, it’s for our flawless victory.
You’ve already had your fun. This year, your little festival is ours!
Oh surprise, surprise—I won. I wouldn’t expect anything less.
See? Wasn’t that a silly waste of time? This celebration is ours!
I’m sorry, darling—you lost. I’m afraid I can’t relate. I don’t know what losing feels like.

It’s over, %PLAYERNAME%. Your strength is undeniable.
You are now the Johto Battle Challenge Champion!
Your dedication to, trust in, and love for your Pokémon made this possible. You won because your Pokémon believed in you, just as you believed in them.
Congratulations, %PLAYERNAME%!
What’re you going to do to celebrate this momentous accomplishment?
Quite the overachiever, %PLAYERNAME%! Your Pokémon look excited to keep battling as well. Together, you really are the perfect team. Get out there and make your team proud!
It’s important to know your limits, %PLAYERNAME%. Being kind to yourself isn’t a weakness.
And your Pokémon look like they could use a rest as well, so why not relax awhile. When you’re ready, there’s plenty of Pokémon to catch and new friends to make.

Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! Check this out—I’ve been practicing.
Hello there! Welcome to the world of Pokémon GO! My name is Willow. People call me the Pokémon Prof!
This world is inhabited by creatures called Pokémon! Some people keep Pokémon as companions. Others have them do battle. Myself? I study Pokémon as a profession.
Did that remind you of anyone? For many years, Trainers from Kanto have heard similar remarks before embarking on their journeys through the region.
I have the honor of making them today because you’re about to head out on your own Kanto-inspired journey.
But we can’t have you leaving unprepared! I’ve put together some supplies I think you’ll find useful.
Berries, Potions, and Poké Balls. Looks like you’re all set!
As you begin today’s adventure, try to imagine you’re stepping straight into the tall grass of Kanto.
I have a feeling you’ll meet a Pokémon that will make a wonderful partner on your journey. Be sure to take some snapshots of the Pokémon you encounter along the way!
On adventures, I find it’s helpful to document not only your findings but also your memories. And I’m sure you’ll make plenty of both!
Now, in the words of a wise professor: Your very own Pokémon legend is about to unfold! A world of dreams and adventures with Pokémon awaits! Let's GO!
How’s your journey going, %PLAYERNAME%? Oh! Found a partner Pokémon to join you, eh? Wonderful work.
In the Kanto region, Trainers are often presented with three options when it comes to their first partner Pokémon.
The first is Bulbasaur, the Seed Pokémon, #001 in the Pokédex. This Grass-type Pokémon has a plant seed on its back right from the day it’s born.
Another option is Charmander, the Lizard Pokémon. It’s a Fire-type Pokémon, and it has a flame on its tail that shows the strength of its life force.
Last—but certainly not least—is Squirtle, the Tiny Turtle Pokémon. After birth, this Water-type Pokémon's back swells and hardens into a shell.
Each of these Pokémon have their strengths and weaknesses, so be sure to study up! For now, though, it’s time to get back to your adventure.
I’d like you to spend some time with your buddy. The relationship between a Trainer and their Pokémon is of utmost importance!
How about going on a walk together? I always enjoy exploring with my buddy!
Wonderful work, Trainer! Glad to see you’re growing closer to your buddy. Keep it up, and you’ll become even closer in no time.
When it comes to being a Trainer, people often talk about catching techniques or battle strategies, but I find that friendship is just as essential.
Not only are the relationships you build with your Pokémon incredibly important, but so are the friendships you build with other Trainers.
Your personal journeys and goals may vary, but at the end of the day, you’re all Trainers! You should do your best to connect with the other Trainers you meet on your travels.
In that spirit, how about sending your friends some Gifts to brighten their day? I’m sure they’d love to hear from you!
Welcome back, Trainer! Hope you enjoyed connecting with other Trainers. I see you were even able to trade a few Pokémon!
Trading is a fabulous way to acquire Pokémon you might not have otherwise encountered.
And not only do you get a new entry in your Pokédex, but you also get a new friend!
You’ve already made great progress on your journey. I think it’s time to show off the skills you’ve learned along the way!
How about showcasing your throwing expertise by catching some Pokémon? Don’t forget to make use of your Berries, too.
I’m especially fond of Pinap Berries. They help you earn extra Candy for the Pokémon you’re catching—and they’re tasty to boot!
I’m sure I had a stash of Pinap Berries here somewhere... Oh! Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! Guess my snack will have to wait.
I’ve been checking up on your progress, and I have to say, I’m very impressed! It seems there’s no challenge you can’t overcome.
As I’m sure you know, a well-rounded Trainer needs to have a great team of Pokémon to battle against other Trainers or even challenge Pokémon in raids.
I think this is a great time to power up some of your Pokémon and bolster your team.
While you focus on that, I’ll be looking into an interesting rumor I caught wind of.
There have been reports of encounters with a Pokémon that’s able to transform into another Pokémon entirely. Fascinating stuff!
I’ll be sure to share whatever I find when you return.
Glad you’re back, Trainer. After looking into those reports, it certainly sounds like the work of Ditto, the Transform Pokémon.
Ditto rearranges its cell structure to transform itself into other shapes. What an incredible Pokémon!
However, there seems to be something more to this situation.
Could you help me with some research so we can find out what exactly is going on?
I’ll continue my work here to see if I can uncover some more information that might help us.
%PLAYERNAME%! Is it true?! You encountered a Shiny Ditto?! I’m stunned!
You’ve had quite the journey, haven’t you? It’s been a joy to follow your progress, as always.
Believe it or not, though, there’s still another mystery that needs solving.
You see, after looking over the research you’ve conducted, I think we might be on the trail of the New Species Pokémon, Mew.
We've documented Mew in the past, but something’s different this time—though I can’t yet say what that is.
Whatever the case, I think it’s safe to say this is going to be a memorable adventure!
In the meantime, keep an eye out for another research assignment. I have a feeling this is going to be an especially challenging endeavor, but I’m sure you’re up to it!
For now, though, I think congratulations are in order. You did a tremendous job on today’s Kanto-themed journey!
I hope you were able to make some special memories with your Pokémon and fellow Trainers. Thanks again for all your help and hard work!
Now, let’s GO!

How embarrassing. Maybe I should take it down a notch...
Mesa Trainer
Embrace your true power.
Victory will be mine!
Don’t beat yourself up about it. This was inevitable.
Win or lose, I stand by my Pokémon!
Cave Trainer
I lose to no one!
If you believe you can win, your Pokémon will believe it, too!
Yeah! That’s the power of my Pokémon.
Care for another battle?
Ocean Trainer
My turn!
I’ll battle you as many times as it takes to win.
Better luck next time!
Awww. If this was a cuteness contest, we totally woulda won.
Cutie beam!
I picked all my Pokémon because they’re super cute—but that doesn’t mean they’re not super strong, too!
Cute doesn’t mean weak.
A well-earned victory. Truly, you are worthy of being called Champion!
Let us see which of us is meant to be Champion!
Purple is such a noble and elegant color, don’t you agree? Quite befitting of a Champion.
Ah, the Champion is me!
In the end, a loss. And in loss, we learn the most. I’ll not forget this.
A sliver of sky. A single speck in the void. Blue, the hue of home.
... ... ...
Spool of fate, unfurl. Respite in a swirling storm. Victory is ours.
You’re blindingly bold!
We’re brighter, we’re bolder, we’re better!
Pokémon should be bold—in color and in strength!
What’d I tell ya? Bold is just better.
Eh. You win some, you lose some.
Savannah Trainer
I’ll keep you on your toes.
Didn’t expect to meet another Trainer here. So random, right?
That was over quick.

I should have known I couldn’t win with borrowed Pokémon...

Curious... Upon their defeat, your opponent seems to have abandoned the Pokémon they battled with. It has a strange and ominous aura.
I have a hypothesis about what kind of Pokémon it is... Could you catch it so we can examine it more closely?
Your opponent fled...and left their Pokémon behind. That really burns me up. There seems to be an ominous aura around the poor Pokémon, too.
Could you try to catch it and see what’s so different about this Pokémon?
They’ve carelessly abandoned the Pokémon they lost with! It has an ominous aura and is somewhat different from regular Pokémon. Try to catch it so we can save it!
They’ve carelessly abandoned the Pokémon they lost with! It has an ominous aura and is somewhat different from regular Pokémon. Try to catch it so we can save it!
Whoa, looks like they couldn’t handle a little battle! They even left behind their Pokémon. Why would they do that?
It has a really odd aura around it... Let’s help it! Can you catch it so we can take a closer look?
Professor Willow’s ingenuity knows no bounds.
Once equipped, the Super Rocket Radar begins receiving encrypted signals. Could the signals be coming from Team GO Rocket Headquarters?
Best prepare for any obstacles that might appear. Team GO Rocket’s numbers are staggering.
Their leader is strong but no match for Team Mystic. Let’s GO.
Just look at this radar! You can just tell it’s more powerful than the others!
My bet? It’s receiving signals from Team GO Rocket Headquarters.
I’m getting fired up, but I know there have to be more hurdles before facing the Team GO Rocket Boss.
I’ve heard their boss is fierce... But you’re on Team Valor, so I know you can handle it.
This radar looks upgraded and WAY more powerful than others we’ve made!
Think it’ll take us to whoever’s leading Team GO Rocket?
I know it can’t be that easy. I bet Team GO Rocket has plenty more Grunts blocking our way.
I’m ready if you are! Equip that radar, and let’s show ’em what Team Instinct is made of!
Professor Willow’s research and the components you’ve discovered have come together to produce a Rocket Radar.
We’ve reverse engineered their technology and can now receive their hideouts’ signals.
Equip the radar to activate it. It’s time to investigate—and be prepared for whatever comes our way.
Great work! Fighting all those Grunts was worth the effort!
A Rocket Radar! Professor Willow said once it’s equipped, you can intercept signals from Team GO Rocket.
Finally, we can find those hideouts! Let’s GO take out these punks!
Whoa! I knew the professor was right when he said these things could be used for something aside from hacking PokéStops!
Is that a radar? Awesome! There’s no way they can hide from us with this!
Let’s try it out and track down some hideouts!
Trainer, some shadowy figures have been seen at PokéStops. Approach with caution, and be ready for battle.
I’ve been hearing reports of some mysterious characters near PokéStops. You should take charge and go investigate. Be careful, and make sure you’re prepared for a battle!
Some mysterious characters have shown up at PokéStops! Watch out—it might turn into a battle!
Some mysterious characters have shown up at PokéStops! Watch out—it might turn into a battle!
I overheard that some shady characters have been showing up at PokéStops. I think you need to check it out, but be careful—I have a feeling you might end up in a battle!
That Grunt dropped some sort of device. It looks like this is what they were using to hack the PokéStops.
Ah, I recognize this from Willow’s lab. I wonder...
Yes. I believe this can help with his prototype. Please head out and collect more.
That Grunt dropped something while they were running scared! What are they using these for?
I bet this is what Team GO Rocket is using to hack the PokéStops...
We have to find more. Time to battle some Grunts!
Hey... That Grunt dropped something. What does this thing do?
This looks like a piece of something right out of Willow’s lab!
I bet this will help with that prototype he’s developing... Let’s see if we can find more.
Your Pokémon storage is full, so you will not be able to encounter a Shadow Pokémon. To make room, you can transfer Pokémon to Professor Willow or upgrade your Pokémon storage in the shop.
Great job getting those Shadow Shards! Good name, eh? Now, let’s combine them. We can use my invention—the Super Shadow Shard Scrubber! But we can just call it the Shard Refiner. Give it a try!
Incredible! They made a beautiful gem, and we’ve purified that shadowy energy. I’ll call it...a Purified Gem! I’ll bet something like this can help calm the enraged Shadow Pokémon in Shadow Raids.
I hypothesize that this will decrease an enraged Shadow Raid Boss’s Attack and Defense. The more of these gems you or other Trainers use, the greater the effect ought to be. Why don’t you test it?
Would you do me a favor and track down a few more by battling Team GO Rocket? When we have {0}, I’ll see if we can put them together to make something that can help in Shadow Raids!
Huh? What’s this? It’s exuding some eerie energy. I wonder if it has something to do with Team GO Rocket’s increased presence and those Shadow Raids...
If my analysis is correct, we can help this Pokémon through a process known as purification. This will enable it to harness its strength. Shall we give it a try?
I think we can help this Pokémon. Purification is a process that makes certain Pokémon stronger by tapping into their inner power. Let’s give it a try.
It looks like we can help this Pokémon become stronger through a process called purification. Let’s try it!
It looks like we can help this Pokémon become stronger through a process called purification. Let’s try it!
Oh! I remember Professor Willow talking about a process called purification! He said that it could help certain Pokémon become more powerful. Let’s give it a shot!

Thank you for all your help with Gyarados and Celebi, %PLAYERNAME%. Though it seems our work isn’t over yet—Team GO Rocket still has Lugia and Ho-Oh.
With the team leaders’ help, we managed to pinpoint Apex Shadow Ho-Oh’s location. For reasons unknown, Team GO Rocket’s keeping the two Pokémon in separate locations.
Perhaps they’ve bitten off more than they can chew with these two Legendary Pokémon? In any case, this makes things easier for us: we’ll save these Pokémon one at a time!
Great work saving Apex Shadow Ho-Oh, %PLAYERNAME%! It looks like it knows Sacred Fire, Ho-Oh’s signature move—yet this one’s Sacred Fire is somehow even more powerful!
I wonder what will happen if you purify it. Will it become even stronger?
I’m going to continue researching this incredible Pokémon. I’ll keep you posted on what I learn.
While I’m off, why don’t you train up your Pokémon and see what friends are available to help with Apex Shadow Lugia.
We’re going to need all the help we can get!
The team leaders and I will also continue our investigation into Apex Shadow Lugia’s whereabouts. I hope we’ll know more soon.
Do you have everything you need, %PLAYERNAME%? Potions? Revives? Snacks?
Saving Apex Shadow Lugia will be an even greater challenge, so be prepared.
The team leaders and I discovered that Team GO Rocket has hidden Apex Shadow Lugia away in a secret hideout, guarded by a gauntlet of Grunts—and standing with them is none other than Giovanni himself.
And while I have you, remember how I said I’d conduct more research into Apex Shadow Ho-Oh?
Well, it turns out that if you purify it, its Sacred Fire move will become immeasurably powerful.
Apex Purified Ho-Oh might be an incredible ally in our quest to save Apex Shadow Lugia.
These may just be some of the toughest battles you’ll face as a Pokémon Trainer yet. But I know you, above all else, are the one most prepared for the challenge.
Great Scott!
%PLAYERNAME%!
You did it!
You saved Apex Shadow Lugia from Team GO Rocket!
Just like Ho-Oh, Apex Shadow Lugia’s Aeroblast attack is more powerful than any I’ve ever seen.
And just like Apex Shadow Ho-Oh, I’m confident that its power will increase even more if you purify it.
Now, I’d say we’re overdue for a celebration! You’ve earned it.
Your recent accomplishments are no small feat!
Thanks again for all your help. I’m sure Lugia and Ho-Oh are grateful, too. Until our next adventure...let’s GO!
What perfect timing, %PLAYERNAME%!
Exciting news—I just found out Jirachi is in the area!
Hoenn legends say that Jirachi can grant any wish that people desire, though it’s only awake seven days out of a thousand years.
But considering there were Jirachi sightings just a few years ago—hardly a thousand!—I hypothesize there’s something special about this Jirachi.
It sounds like we need to locate the Wish Pokémon for ourselves!
Without a clear starting point, we should cast a wide net.
I recommend we start the search by looking into Pokémon from the Kanto, Johto, and Hoenn regions.
Maybe researching one of those Pokémon will give us the lead we need!
Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! No Jirachi leads, I’m afraid, but seeing you catch those Pokémon made me think about how much you’ve grown in your journey as a Trainer.
Ah! I’ve got an idea! “I wish we knew where to find Jirachi!”
... ... ...
Oh well—I suppose Jirachi’s not granting that particular wish. It was worth a shot!
But that’s enough wishing from me. Say...what do you think your Pokémon would wish for?
To spend some time together? Or maybe to share a tasty snack?
Why don’t you take a moment to get in tune with your Pokémon’s wishes, %PLAYERNAME%, while I noodle on more ways to locate Jirachi.
You and your Pokémon are looking refreshed and ready to continue the search for Jirachi, %PLAYERNAME%!
Something occurred to me while you were away—Jirachi was originally discovered in the Hoenn region, as you may already know.
But it’s not the only elusive Pokémon first discovered in that region.
It shares that honor with Kecleon, the Color Swap Pokémon. Kecleon can change the colors of its body at will to blend in with its surroundings.
There’s one exception—it can’t change the zigzag pattern on its belly. Looking for that distinctive pattern is the key to spotting Kecleon, but even that trick doesn’t make it easy!
I was years into my Pokémon studies before I came across my first Kecleon.
Have you encountered a Kecleon yet? Who knows how many times you’ve been standing right next to one without knowing it!
I’ve heard Trainers have had luck finding Kecleon around PokéStops. Maybe Jirachi’s taken up the same proclivity for hiding!
You’ve got sharp eyes, %PLAYERNAME%! I’ve never seen so many Kecleon in one place. It’s rare to see any Kecleon at all, with their expert camouflaging skills.
Unfortunately for us, it seems like Jirachi might be even harder to spot than Kecleon.
But I, for one, am undaunted! Keeping your confidence and spirits high is key both in research and in life, I say.
Maybe what we need is a little dash of luck to move us ahead.
And what’s luckier than a Lucky Pokémon, eh, %PLAYERNAME%?
Hey there %PLAYERNAME%! Feeling any luckier with your new Pokémon?
I know I am! I’ve got a good feeling that Jirachi is closer than ever.
Now let’s put that luck to use with some good old-fashioned exploring!
We can take some inspiration from Jirachi’s sleep schedule.
As you know, Jirachi is only awake for seven days out of  a thousand years.
So how about you try dedicating seven days to research? Or catching a thousand Pokémon? I know it’s a lot to ask, but maybe Jirachi will appreciate the perseverance.
Although I hope you’ll be around to help me with my research for a lot longer than a week, %PLAYERNAME%! 
%PLAYERNAME%, you did it—you’ve found our elusive Jirachi!
It was no easy task, but you persevered through thick and thin. You’ve done me proud again!
It seems our new friend really is different from the Jirachi observed a few years ago. This is a Shiny Jirachi, as I’m sure you’ve noticed from its unique coloring!
I wonder if it has different habits. Does its sleep schedule differ? What about its temperament?
Ahem. Sorry about that. It’s hard to contain my excitement when I think about all there is to learn about Pokémon!
In fact, my fondest wish is that we can keep learning—together!
Ah, %PLAYERNAME%! Glad to have you aboard this expedition. Say, have you ever heard this particular tune?
Da da da doo, da dee da dum... That’s what I hear in my head when I think of a certain sailor and his Wingull that I met while traveling through the Hoenn region in my younger years.
I believe the tune was originally a sea shanty. Sailors would sing songs like this together on their seafaring adventures to keep morale high and help find a rhythm during certain tasks.
I’m no sailor, but I do find myself feeling luckier after humming it! Haha!
Anyway, we’re here to look into the strange situation we uncovered during your Kanto-themed journey.
I’m talking, of course, about reports of encounters with Mew, the New Species Pokémon. There have been several sightings of a Shiny one recently, which is tremendously exciting!
That means our goal on this expedition is to find not only one of the most elusive Pokémon to ever exist, but a Shiny one at that!
You’ve experienced a lot on your journeys thus far, %PLAYERNAME%. But perhaps the most wonderful thing about Pokémon is that there’s always something new to discover.
I hope you’re excited for what’s to come, because I have a feeling it’s going to be a real test of your skills as a Trainer!
Let’s GO!
Wow, %PLAYERNAME%—great work! Your knowledge of the Kanto region is beginning to rival even my own!
Our next task is to learn more about Pokémon DNA.
I know that sounds pretty heavy on the science, but don’t worry—I’ll take care of that part. All I need you to do is get out there and catch lots of different types of Pokémon!
Mew’s DNA is said to contain the genetic codes of all Pokémon, so to better understand Mew, we should try to understand as much as we can about the genetics of other Pokémon.
Incredible work, %PLAYERNAME%! Seeing you learn so much about different Pokémon reminded me of how vast the world of Pokémon truly is.
Knowledge is funny in that the more we gain, the more realize how much we still lack. Some might find that frustrating, but for me it’s inspiring!
You know, there’s a part in that sea shanty I mentioned before that seems applicable here.
I don’t remember the exact words, but the gist is that we should travel across the land, searching far and wide to learn about all the amazing Pokémon there are in the world.
Words to live by, I say! Let’s get out there and track down that Shiny Mew, Trainer!
%PLAYERNAME%, you... You did it! You actually found and caught a Shiny Mew!
Has it even sunk in yet? This is a monumental achievement, Trainer. Take a moment to congratulate yourself!
Hm? It’s my achievement as well? Haha! No, no, I just hummed you a shanty and guided you like any Pokémon Professor worth their sea salt would.
But thanks are certainly in order for the Pokémon you’ve befriended on your journey. They played a big part in your research, after all!
The ones you’ve caught, the ones you’ve battled with, and the ones that traveled with you as your buddy—each Pokémon played a critical part in helping you achieve this goal.
As Trainers, we owe an eternal debt to our Pokémon. After all, we can’t very well be Trainers without them!
A Trainer’s journey is meant to be filled with amazing memories, ambitious dreams, and unexpected adventures. I think this particular journey checked all those boxes pretty handily!
I’m sure it won’t be the last to do so, either. Now, until next time...let’s GO!

You can also use Mega Energy to Mega Evolve your Pokémon before then.
Mega Evolution Features
<b>Using Mega Energy</b>You can always Mega Evolve a Pokémon using Mega Energy even if the Pokémon is in a rest period. The Mega Energy required to do so will depend on the length of the rest period. <b>Rest</b>Your Pokémon will need to rest after Mega Evolving without using Mega Energy. A Pokémon’s rest periods will become shorter the more it Mega Evolves.
Two Ways to Mega Evolve
Mega Energy is unique to each Pokémon species and can be earned using the following methods.• Win Mega Raids.• Complete certain research tasks.• Adventure with a Buddy Pokémon that can Mega Evolve.

Rest Periods
Each Mega-Evolved Pokémon has a Mega Level. When a Pokémon’s Mega Level increases, you’ll get more bonuses, and the period you’ll have to wait before you can Mega Evolve the Pokémon again will be shorter. Each time you Mega Evolve a Pokémon, you work toward increasing its Mega Level.

MY SCORE
What’s that you’ve got, %PLAYERNAME%? Ah! Yes, I see—this appears to be a very old coin.  I picked one up myself, actually. There’s something mysterious about them...
Professor Willow? Can you hear me?
All right, %PLAYERNAME%—let’s get cracking! I’d like to find a few more coins, so why don’t we start looking around?
These coins are a little suspicious, but I can’t help feeling excited all the same! I believe a thorough investigation is in order.
We’ve got a lot of ground to cover—so I’ll start my search over there! Are you ready? Then let’s GO!
Oh—hello, Jacq! It was great hearing you speak at the World Pokémon Ecological Society conference the other day!
Thank you. Your lecture, “Strolling through the World of Pokémon,” was fantastic, too!
%PLAYERNAME%, this is Jacq. He teaches biology at an academy in the Paldea region.
It’s very nice to meet you! Hm? Oh! That coin...!
Hm? Do you know something about this, Jacq?
I think I might... I know we were supposed to discuss Diglett, but can I get a rain check? This is something that I want to look into!
Of course! I’ll get right on researching this with %PLAYERNAME%. And I’ll be sure to take a video of the coin and share it with you soon.
Thank you! I’ll see you later, then. Happy exploring!

Hello there!I am Professor Willow.
Did you know that this world is inhabited by creatures known as Pokémon?
Pokémon can be found in every corner of the earth.
Some run across the plains, others fly through the skies, some live in the mountains, or in the forests, or near water…
I have spent my whole life studying them and their geography.
Will you help me with my research?
That’s great!

A PokéStop is an in-game location that encourages Trainers to go outside, discover new places, and connect with people in the community. PokéStops usually contain some kind of civic, educational, or artistic value, whether it’s a cool piece of art or a hidden gem that only the locals know.
Submit a name, description, and photo of the location you’ve selected. Your nominated PokéStop will then be reviewed by other Niantic players, so please be thorough and accurate!
PokéStops should have educational and cultural value, and their locations should be safe and accessible to pedestrians. Avoid nominating locations at private residences, locations that are seasonal or nonpermanent, or locations that could interfere with emergency service vehicles. 
Write a concise title and a detailed description of your nominated PokéStop. The title should be an official name when possible. The description should include the history, cultural significance, or educational value of your location. Write the title and description yourself and please do not copy from other resources.

Pokémon Day
--
Bulbasaur can be seen napping in bright sunlight. There is a seed on its back. By soaking up the sun's rays, the seed grows progressively larger.
There is a bud on this Pokémon's back. To support its weight, Ivysaur's legs and trunk grow thick and strong. If it starts spending more time lying in the sunlight, it's a sign that the bud will bloom into a large flower soon.
There is a large flower on Venusaur's back. The flower is said to take on vivid colors if it gets plenty of nutrition and sunlight. The flower's aroma soothes the emotions of people.
The flame that burns at the tip of its tail is an indication of its emotions. The flame wavers when Charmander is enjoying itself. If the Pokémon becomes enraged, the flame burns fiercely.
Charmeleon mercilessly destroys its foes using its sharp claws. If it encounters a strong foe, it turns aggressive. In this excited state, the flame at the tip of its tail flares with a bluish white color.
Charizard flies around the sky in search of powerful opponents. It breathes fire of such great heat that it melts anything. However, it never turns its fiery breath on any opponent weaker than itself.
Squirtle's shell is not merely used for protection. The shell's rounded shape and the grooves on its surface help minimize resistance in water, enabling this Pokémon to swim at high speeds.
Its tail is large and covered with a rich, thick fur. The tail becomes increasingly deeper in color as Wartortle ages. The scratches on its shell are evidence of this Pokémon's toughness as a battler.
Blastoise has water spouts that protrude from its shell. The water spouts are very accurate. They can shoot bullets of water with enough accuracy to strike empty cans from a distance of over 160 feet.
Caterpie has a voracious appetite. It can devour leaves bigger than its body right before your eyes. From its antenna, this Pokémon releases a terrifically strong odor.
The shell covering this Pokémon's body is as hard as an iron slab. Metapod does not move very much. It stays still because it is preparing its soft innards for evolution inside the hard shell.
Butterfree has a superior ability to search for delicious honey from flowers. It can even search out, extract, and carry honey from flowers that are blooming over six miles from its nest.
Weedle has an extremely acute sense of smell. It is capable of distinguishing its favorite kinds of leaves from those it dislikes just by sniffing with its big red proboscis (nose).
Kakuna remains virtually immobile as it clings to a tree. However, on the inside, it is extremely busy as it prepares for its coming evolution. This is evident from how hot the shell becomes to the touch.
Beedrill is extremely territorial. No one should ever approach its nest—this is for their own safety. If angered, they will attack in a furious swarm.
Pidgey has an extremely sharp sense of direction. It is capable of unerringly returning home to its nest, however far it may be removed from its familiar surroundings.
Pidgeotto claims a large area as its own territory. This Pokémon flies around, patrolling its living space. If its territory is violated, it shows no mercy in thoroughly punishing the foe with its sharp claws.
This Pokémon has a dazzling plumage of beautifully glossy feathers. Many Trainers are captivated by the striking beauty of the feathers on its head, compelling them to choose Pidgeot as their Pokémon.
Rattata is cautious in the extreme. Even while it is asleep, it constantly listens by moving its ears around. It is not picky about where it lives—it will make its nest anywhere.
Night after night, they sneak into people's homes seeking food. A massive outbreak of them has become an issue of public concern.
Raticate's sturdy fangs grow steadily. To keep them ground down, it gnaws on rocks and logs. It may even chew on the walls of houses.
It commands a nest of Rattata. Different nests don't get along, whipping up severe fights over feeding grounds.
Spearow has a very loud cry that can be heard over half a mile away. If its high, keening cry is heard echoing all around, it is a sign that they are warning each other of danger.
Fearow is recognized by its long neck and elongated beak. They are conveniently shaped for catching prey in soil or water. It deftly moves its long and skinny beak to pluck prey.
Ekans curls itself up in a spiral while it rests. Assuming this position allows it to quickly respond to a threat from any direction with a glare from its upraised head.
This Pokémon is terrifically strong in order to constrict things with its body. It can even flatten steel oil drums. Once Arbok wraps its body around its foe, escaping its crushing embrace is impossible.
Whenever Pikachu comes across something new, it blasts it with a jolt of electricity. If you come across a blackened berry, it's evidence that this Pokémon mistook the intensity of its charge.
If the electrical sacs become excessively charged, Raichu plants its tail in the ground and discharges. Scorched patches of ground will be found near this Pokémon's nest.
When you rub its cheeks, a sweet fragrance comes wafting out. However, you'll also get a light shock!
Sandshrew's body is configured to absorb water without waste, enabling it to survive in an arid desert. This Pokémon curls up to protect itself from its enemies.
The skin on its back is as hard as steel. Predators go after its soft belly, so it clings to the ground desperately.
Sandslash's body is covered by tough spikes, which are hardened sections of its hide. Once a year, the old spikes fall out, to be replaced with new spikes that grow out from beneath the old ones.
A long, long time ago, it lived in the desert. With its sharp claws fully extended, it can climb right up an iceberg without slipping.
Nidoran♀ has barbs that secrete a powerful poison. They are thought to have developed as protection for this small-bodied Pokémon. When enraged, it releases a horrible toxin from its horn.
When Nidorina are with their friends or family, they keep their barbs tucked away to prevent hurting each other. This Pokémon appears to become nervous if separated from the others.
Nidoqueen's body is encased in extremely hard scales. It is adept at sending foes flying with harsh tackles. This Pokémon is at its strongest when it is defending its young.
Nidoran♂ has developed muscles for moving its ears. Thanks to them, the ears can be freely moved in any direction. Even the slightest sound does not escape this Pokémon's notice.
Nidorino has a horn that is harder than a diamond. If it senses a hostile presence, all the barbs on its back bristle up at once, and it challenges the foe with all its might.
Nidoking's thick tail packs enormously destructive power. With one swing, it can topple a metal transmission tower. Once this Pokémon goes on a rampage, there is no stopping it.
On every night of a full moon, groups of this Pokémon come out to play. When dawn arrives, the tired Clefairy return to their quiet mountain retreats and go to sleep nestled up against each other.
Clefable moves by skipping lightly as if it were flying using its wings. Its bouncy step lets it even walk on water. It is known to take strolls on lakes on quiet, moonlit nights.
At the time of its birth, Vulpix has one white tail. The tail separates into six if this Pokémon receives plenty of love from its Trainer. The six tails become magnificently curled.
They live together in a skulk, helping one another. Before eating their prey, they freeze it solid with their –58 degree Fahrenheit breath.
Ninetales casts a sinister light from its bright red eyes to gain total control over its foe's mind. This Pokémon is said to live for a thousand years.
Some said that deities visited mountains where Ninetales live, so in times long past, no one was allowed to go into those mountains.
Jigglypuff's vocal cords can freely adjust the wavelength of its voice. This Pokémon uses this ability to sing at precisely the right wavelength to make its foes most drowsy.
Wigglytuff has large, saucerlike eyes. The surfaces of its eyes are always covered with a thin layer of tears. If any dust gets in this Pokémon's eyes, it is quickly washed away.
Zubat remains quietly unmoving in a dark spot during the bright daylight hours. It does so because prolonged exposure to the sun causes its body to become slightly burned.
Golbat loves to drink the blood of living things. It is particularly active in the pitch black of night. This Pokémon flits around in the night skies, seeking fresh blood.
During the daytime, Oddish buries itself in soil to absorb nutrients from the ground using its entire body. The more fertile the soil, the glossier its leaves become.
Gloom releases a foul fragrance from the pistil of its flower. When faced with danger, the stench worsens. If this Pokémon is feeling calm and secure, it does not release its usual stinky aroma.
Vileplume's toxic pollen triggers atrocious allergy attacks. That's why it is advisable never to approach any attractive flowers in a jungle, however pretty they may be.
Paras has parasitic mushrooms growing on its back called tochukaso. They grow large by drawing nutrients from this Bug Pokémon host. They are highly valued as a medicine for extending life.
Parasect is known to infest large trees en masse and drain nutrients from the lower trunk and roots. When an infested tree dies, they move onto another tree all at once.
Venonat is said to have evolved with a coat of thin, stiff hair that covers its entire body for protection. It possesses large eyes that never fail to spot even minuscule prey.
Venomoth is nocturnal—it is a Pokémon that only becomes active at night. Its favorite prey are small insects that gather around streetlights, attracted by the light in the darkness.
Diglett are raised in most farms. The reason is simple—wherever this Pokémon burrows, the soil is left perfectly tilled for planting crops. This soil is made ideal for growing delicious vegetables.
The need to dig through volcanic rock in the ground has made them more powerful than the Diglett of other regions.
Dugtrio are actually triplets that emerged from one body. As a result, each triplet thinks exactly like the other two triplets. They work cooperatively to burrow endlessly.
Its shining gold whiskers are advanced sensors that can detect vibrations from sounds several miles away.
Meowth withdraws its sharp claws into its paws to slinkily sneak about without making any incriminating footsteps. For some reason, this Pokémon loves shiny coins that glitter with light.
A royal house that flourished in the distant past brought it here from another region. Meowth is both selfish and prideful.
Living with a savage, seafaring people has toughened this Pokémon's body so much that parts of it have turned to iron.
Persian has six bold whiskers that give it a look of toughness. The whiskers sense air movements to determine what is in the Pokémon's surrounding vicinity. It becomes docile if grabbed by the whiskers.
Its round face is a symbol of wealth. Persian that have bigger, plumper faces are considered more beautiful.
Psyduck uses a mysterious power. When it does so, this Pokémon generates brain waves that are supposedly only seen in sleepers. This discovery spurred controversy among scholars.
The webbed flippers on its forelegs and hind legs and the streamlined body of Golduck give it frightening speed. This Pokémon is definitely much faster than even the most athletic swimmer.
When Mankey starts shaking and its nasal breathing turns rough, it's a sure sign that it is becoming angry. However, because it goes into a towering rage almost instantly, it is impossible for anyone to flee its wrath.
When Primeape becomes furious, its blood circulation is boosted. In turn, its muscles are made even stronger. However, it also becomes much less intelligent at the same time.
Growlithe has a superb sense of smell. Once it smells anything, this Pokémon won't forget the scent, no matter what. It uses its advanced olfactory sense to determine the emotions of other living things.
They patrol their territory in pairs. I believe the igneous rock components in the fur of this species are the result of volcanic activity in its habitat.
Arcanine is known for its high speed. It is said to be capable of running over 6,200 miles in a single day and night. The fire that blazes wildly within this Pokémon's body is its source of power.
Snaps at its foes with fangs cloaked in blazing flame. Despite its bulk, it deftly feints every which way, leading opponents on a deceptively merry chase as it all but dances around them.
Poliwag has a very thin skin. It is possible to see the Pokémon's spiral innards right through the skin. Despite its thinness, however, the skin is also very flexible. Even sharp fangs bounce right off it.
The surface of Poliwhirl's body is always wet and slick with a slimy fluid. Because of this slippery covering, it can easily slip and slide out of the clutches of any enemy in battle.
Poliwrath's highly developed, brawny muscles never grow fatigued, however much it exercises. It is so tirelessly strong, this Pokémon can swim back and forth across the ocean without effort.
Abra sleeps for 18 hours a day. However, it can sense the presence of foes even while it is sleeping. In such a situation, this Pokémon immediately teleports to safety.
Kadabra emits a peculiar alpha wave if it develops a headache. Only those people with a particularly strong psyche can hope to become a Trainer of this Pokémon.
Alakazam's brain continually grows, making its head far too heavy to support with its neck. This Pokémon holds its head up using its psychokinetic power instead.
Machop's muscles are special—they never get sore no matter how much they are used in exercise. This Pokémon has sufficient power to hurl a hundred adult humans.
Machoke's thoroughly toned muscles possess the hardness of steel. This Pokémon has so much strength, it can easily hold aloft a sumo wrestler on just one finger.
Machamp has the power to hurl anything aside. However, trying to do any work requiring care and dexterity causes its arms to get tangled. This Pokémon tends to leap into action before it thinks.
Bellsprout's thin and flexible body lets it bend and sway to avoid any attack, however strong it may be. From its mouth, this Pokémon spits a corrosive fluid that melts even iron.
Weepinbell has a large hook on its rear end. At night, the Pokémon hooks on to a tree branch and goes to sleep. If it moves around in its sleep, it may wake up to find itself on the ground.
Victreebel has a long vine that extends from its head. This vine is waved and flicked about as if it were an animal to attract prey. When an unsuspecting prey draws near, this Pokémon swallows it whole.
Tentacool's body is largely composed of water. If it is removed from the sea, it dries up like parchment. If this Pokémon happens to become dehydrated, put it back into the sea.
Tentacruel has large red orbs on its head. The orbs glow before lashing the vicinity with a harsh ultrasonic blast. This Pokémon's outburst creates rough waves around it.
The longer a Geodude lives, the more its edges are chipped and worn away, making it more rounded in appearance. However, this Pokémon's heart will remain hard, craggy, and rough always.
Geodude compete against each other with headbutts. The iron sand on their heads will stick to whichever one has stronger magnetism.
Graveler grows by feeding on rocks. Apparently, it prefers to eat rocks that are covered in moss. This Pokémon eats its way through a ton of rocks on a daily basis.
Graveler's entire body is tinged with electricity due to the stones it likes to eat. It's very quick-tempered.
Golem live up on mountains. If there is a large earthquake, these Pokémon will come rolling down off the mountains en masse to the foothills below.
It shoots large rocks that are charged with electricity. Tremendous electric shocks are flung out across the whole area of impact.
Ponyta is very weak at birth. It can barely stand up. This Pokémon becomes stronger by stumbling and falling to keep up with its parent.
Its small horn hides a healing power. With a few rubs from this Pokémon’s horn, any slight wound you have will be healed.
Rapidash usually can be seen casually cantering in the fields and plains. However, when this Pokémon turns serious, its fiery manes flare and blaze as it gallops its way up to 150 mph.
Little can stand up to its psycho cut. Unleashed from this Pokémon’s horn, the move will punch a hole right through a thick metal sheet.
Slowpoke uses its tail to catch prey by dipping it in water at the side of a river. However, this Pokémon often forgets what it's doing and often spends entire days just loafing at water's edge.
Although this Pokémon is normally zoned out, its expression abruptly sharpens on occasion. The cause for this seems to lie in Slowpoke's diet.
Slowbro's tail has a Shellder firmly attached with a bite. As a result, the tail can't be used for fishing anymore. This causes Slowbro to grudgingly swim and catch prey instead.
A Shellder bite set off a chemical reaction with the spices inside Slowbro's body, causing Slowbro to become a Poison-type Pokémon.
Magnemite attaches itself to power lines to feed on electricity. If your house has a power outage, check your circuit breakers. You may find a large number of this Pokémon clinging to the breaker box.
Magneton emits a powerful magnetic force that is fatal to mechanical devices. As a result, large cities sound sirens to warn citizens of large-scale outbreaks of this Pokémon.
Farfetch'd is always seen with a stalk from a plant of some sort. Apparently, there are good stalks and bad stalks. This Pokémon has been known to fight with others over stalks.
The Farfetch'd of the Galar region are brave warriors, and they wield thick, tough leeks in battle.
Doduo's two heads never sleep at the same time. Its two heads take turns sleeping, so one head can always keep watch for enemies while the other one sleeps.
Watch out if Dodrio's three heads are looking in three separate directions. It's a sure sign that it is on its guard. Don't go near this Pokémon if it's being wary—it may decide to peck you.
Seel hunts for prey in the frigid sea underneath sheets of ice. When it needs to breathe, it punches a hole through the ice with the sharply protruding section of its head.
Dewgong loves to snooze on bitterly cold ice. The sight of this Pokémon sleeping on a glacier was mistakenly thought to be a mermaid by a mariner long ago.
Grimer's sludgy and rubbery body can be forced through any opening, however small it may be. This Pokémon enters sewer pipes to drink filthy wastewater.
Brought to Alola to solve the garbage problem, Grimer seems to relish any and all kinds of trash.
From Muk's body seeps a foul fluid that gives off a nose-bendingly horrible stench. Just one drop of this Pokémon's body fluid can turn a pool stagnant and rancid.
What look like fangs and claws are actually crystallized poison that will afflict you at a mere touch, so don't get too close.
At night, this Pokémon uses its broad tongue to burrow a hole in the seafloor sand and then sleep in it. While it is sleeping, Shellder closes its shell, but leaves its tongue hanging out.
Cloyster is capable of swimming in the sea. It does so by swallowing water, then jetting it out toward the rear. This Pokémon shoots spikes from its shell using the same system.
Gastly is largely composed of gaseous matter. When exposed to a strong wind, the gaseous body quickly dwindles away. Groups of this Pokémon cluster under the eaves of houses to escape the ravages of wind.
Haunter is a dangerous Pokémon. If one beckons you while floating in darkness, you must never approach it. This Pokémon will try to lick you with its tongue and steal your life away.
Sometimes, on a dark night, your shadow thrown by a streetlight will suddenly and startlingly overtake you. It is actually a Gengar running past you, pretending to be your shadow.
Onix has a magnet in its brain. It acts as a compass so that this Pokémon does not lose direction while it is tunneling. As it grows older, its body becomes increasingly rounder and smoother.
If your nose becomes itchy while you are sleeping, it's a sure sign that one of these Pokémon is standing above your pillow and trying to eat your dream through your nostrils.
Hypno holds a pendulum in its hand. The arcing movement and glitter of the pendulum lull the foe into a deep state of hypnosis. While this Pokémon searches for prey, it polishes the pendulum.
Krabby live on beaches, burrowed inside holes dug into the sand. On sandy beaches with little in the way of food, these Pokémon can be seen squabbling with each other over territory.
Kingler has an enormous, oversized claw. It waves this huge claw in the air to communicate with others. However, because the claw is so heavy, the Pokémon quickly tires.
Voltorb was first sighted at a company that manufactures Poké Balls. The link between that sighting and the fact that this Pokémon looks very similar to a Poké Ball remains a mystery.
An enigmatic Pokémon that happens to bear a resemblance to a Poké Ball. When excited, it discharges the electric current it has stored in its belly, then lets out a great, uproarious laugh.
Electrode eats electricity in the atmosphere. On days when lightning strikes, you can see this Pokémon exploding all over the place from eating too much electricity.
The tissue on the surface of its body is curiously similar in composition to an Apricorn. When irritated, this Pokémon lets loose an electric current equal to 20 lightning bolts.
This Pokémon consists of six eggs that form a closely knit cluster. The six eggs attract each other and spin around. When cracks increasingly appear on the eggs, Exeggcute is close to evolution.
Exeggutor originally came from the tropics. Its heads steadily grow larger from exposure to strong sunlight. It is said that when the heads fall off, they group together to form Exeggcute.
It swings its long neck like a whip and smacks its opponents. This makes Exeggutor itself dizzy, too.
Cubone pines for the mother it will never see again. Seeing a likeness of its mother in the full moon, it cries. The stains on the skull the Pokémon wears are made by the tears it sheds.
Marowak is the evolved form of a Cubone that has overcome its sadness at the loss of its mother and grown tough. This Pokémon's tempered and hardened spirit is not easily broken.
When it beats opponents with its bone, the cursed flames spread to them. No amount of water will stop those flames from burning.
Hitmonlee's legs freely contract and stretch. Using these springlike legs, it bowls over foes with devastating kicks. After battle, it rubs down its legs and loosens the muscles to overcome fatigue.
Hitmonchan is said to possess the spirit of a boxer who had been working toward a world championship. This Pokémon has an indomitable spirit and will never give up in the face of adversity.
Whenever Lickitung comes across something new, it will unfailingly give it a lick. It does so because it memorizes things by texture and by taste. It is somewhat put off by sour things.
If Koffing becomes agitated, it raises the toxicity of its internal gases and jets them out from all over its body. This Pokémon may also overinflate its round body, then explode.
Weezing loves the gases given off by rotted kitchen garbage. This Pokémon will find a dirty, unkempt house and make it its home. At night, when the people in the house are asleep, it will go through the trash.
This Pokémon consumes particles that contaminate the air. Instead of leaving droppings, it expels clean air.
Rhyhorn runs in a straight line, smashing everything in its path. It is not bothered even if it rushes headlong into a block of steel. This Pokémon may feel some pain from the collision the next day, however.
Rhydon's horn can crush even uncut diamonds. One sweeping blow of its tail can topple a building. This Pokémon's hide is extremely tough. Even direct cannon hits don't leave a scratch.
Chansey lays nutritionally excellent eggs on an everyday basis. The eggs are so delicious, they are easily and eagerly devoured by even those people who have lost their appetite.
Tangela's vines snap off easily if they are grabbed. This happens without pain, allowing it to make a quick getaway. The lost vines are replaced by newly grown vines the very next day.
If you come across a young Kangaskhan playing by itself, you must never disturb it or attempt to catch it. The baby Pokémon's parent is sure to be in the area, and it will become violently enraged at you.
Horsea eats small insects and moss off of rocks. If the ocean current turns fast, this Pokémon anchors itself by wrapping its tail around rocks or coral to prevent being washed away.
Seadra sleeps after wriggling itself between the branches of coral. Those trying to harvest coral are occasionally stung by this Pokémon's poison barbs if they fail to notice it.
Goldeen is a very beautiful Pokémon with fins that billow elegantly in water. However, don't let your guard down around this Pokémon—it could ram you powerfully with its horn.
In the autumn, Seaking males can be seen performing courtship dances in riverbeds to woo females. During this season, this Pokémon's body coloration is at its most beautiful.
Staryu's center section has an organ called the core that shines bright red. If you go to a beach toward the end of summer, the glowing cores of these Pokémon look like the stars in the sky.
Starmie's center section—the core—glows brightly in seven colors. Because of its luminous nature, this Pokémon has been given the nickname “the gem of the sea.”
Mr. Mime is a master of pantomime. Its gestures and motions convince watchers that something unseeable actually exists. Once the watchers are convinced, the unseeable thing exists as if it were real.
Its talent is tap-dancing. It can also manipulate temperatures to create a floor of ice, which this Pokémon can kick up to use as a barrier.
Scyther is blindingly fast. Its blazing speed enhances the effectiveness of the twin scythes on its forearms. This Pokémon's scythes are so effective, they can slice through thick logs in one wicked stroke.
Jynx walks rhythmically, swaying and shaking its hips as if it were dancing. Its motions are so bouncingly alluring, people seeing it are compelled to shake their hips without giving any thought to what they are doing.
When a storm arrives, gangs of this Pokémon compete with each other to scale heights that are likely to be stricken by lightning bolts. Some towns use Electabuzz in place of lightning rods.
In battle, Magmar blows out intensely hot flames from all over its body to intimidate its opponent. This Pokémon's fiery bursts create heat waves that ignite grass and trees in its surroundings.
Pinsir is astoundingly strong. It can grip a foe weighing twice its weight in its horns and easily lift it. This Pokémon's movements turn sluggish in cold places.
This Pokémon is not satisfied unless it is rampaging at all times. If there is no opponent for Tauros to battle, it will charge at thick trees and knock them down to calm itself.
Magikarp is a pathetic excuse for a Pokémon that is only capable of flopping and splashing. This behavior prompted scientists to undertake research into it.
When Magikarp evolves into Gyarados, its brain cells undergo a structural transformation. It is said that this transformation is to blame for this Pokémon's wildly violent nature.
People have driven Lapras almost to the point of extinction. In the evenings, this Pokémon is said to sing plaintively as it seeks what few others of its kind still remain.
Ditto rearranges its cell structure to transform itself into other shapes. However, if it tries to transform itself into something by relying on its memory, this Pokémon manages to get details wrong.
Eevee has an unstable genetic makeup that suddenly mutates due to the environment in which it lives. Radiation from various stones causes this Pokémon to evolve.
Vaporeon underwent a spontaneous mutation and grew fins and gills that allow it to live underwater. This Pokémon has the ability to freely control water.
Jolteon's cells generate a low level of electricity. This power is amplified by the static electricity of its fur, enabling the Pokémon to drop thunderbolts. The bristling fur is made of electrically charged needles.
Flareon's fluffy fur has a functional purpose—it releases heat into the air so that its body does not get excessively hot. This Pokémon's body temperature can rise to a maximum of 1,650 degrees Fahrenheit.
Porygon is capable of reverting itself entirely back to program data and entering cyberspace. This Pokémon is copy protected so it cannot be duplicated by copying.
Omanyte is one of the ancient and long-since-extinct Pokémon that have been regenerated from fossils by people. If attacked by an enemy, it withdraws itself inside its hard shell.
Omastar uses its tentacles to capture its prey. It is believed to have become extinct because its shell grew too large and heavy, causing its movements to become too slow and ponderous.
Kabuto is a Pokémon that has been regenerated from a fossil. However, in extremely rare cases, living examples have been discovered. The Pokémon has not changed at all for 300 million years.
Kabutops swam underwater to hunt for its prey in ancient times. The Pokémon was apparently evolving from being a water dweller to living on land as evident from the beginnings of change in its gills and legs.

Five of them are troopers, and one is the brass. The brass's orders are absolute.
It feeds on seaweed, using its teeth to scrape it off rocks. Electric current flows from the tips of its spines.
It spits out thread imbued with a frigid sort of energy and uses it to tie its body to branches, disguising itself as an icicle while it sleeps.
Icy scales fall from its wings like snow as it flies over fields and mountains. The temperature of its wings is less than −290 degrees Fahrenheit.
It stands in grasslands, watching the sun's descent from zenith to horizon. This Pokémon has a talent for delivering dynamic kicks.
It drifted in on the flow of ocean waters from a frigid place. It keeps its head iced constantly to make sure it stays nice and cold.

The ice covering this Pokémon's face has shattered, revealing a slightly worried expression that many people are enamored with.
It uses the horns on its head to sense the emotions of others. Males will act as valets for those they serve, looking after their every need.
These intelligent Pokémon touch horns with each other to share information between them.

As it eats the seeds stored up in its pocket-like pouches, this Pokémon is not just satisfying its constant hunger. It's also generating electricity.
As it eats the seeds stored up in its pocket-like pouches, this Pokémon is not just satisfying its constant hunger. It's also generating electricity.
Intense hunger drives it to extremes of violence, and the electricity in its cheek sacs has converted into a Dark-type energy.
It digs up the ground with its trunk. It's also very strong, being able to carry loads of over five tons without any problem at all.
They came over from another region long ago and worked together with humans. Their green skin is resistant to water.
In ancient times, it was unbeatable thanks to its powerful lower body, but it went extinct anyway after it depleted all its plant-based food sources.
The shaking of its freezing upper half is what generates its electricity. It has a hard time walking around.
Powerful legs and jaws made it the apex predator of its time. Its own overhunting of its prey was what drove it to extinction.
Though it's able to capture prey by freezing its surroundings, it has trouble eating the prey afterward because its mouth is on top of its head.
Its body resembles polished metal, and it's both lightweight and strong. The only drawback is that it rusts easily.
After being reborn as a ghost Pokémon, Dreepy wanders the areas it used to inhabit back when it was alive in prehistoric seas.
It's capable of flying faster than 120 mph. It battles alongside Dreepy and dotes on them until they successfully evolve.
When it isn't battling, it keeps Dreepy in the holes on its horns. Once a fight starts, it launches the Dreepy like supersonic missiles.
Known as a legendary hero, this Pokémon absorbs metal particles, transforming them into a weapon it uses to battle.
Now armed with a weapon it used in ancient times, this Pokémon needs only a single strike to fell even Gigantamax Pokémon.

The core on its chest absorbs energy emanating from the lands of the Galar region. This energy is what allows Eternatus to stay active.
Kubfu trains hard to perfect its moves. The moves it masters will determine which form it takes when it evolves.
This form of Urshifu is a strong believer in the one-hit KO. Its strategy is to leap in close to foes and land a devastating blow with a hardened fist.
It's believed that this Pokémon modeled its fighting style on the flow of a river—sometimes rapid, sometimes calm.
This form of Urshifu is a strong believer in the one-hit KO. Its strategy is to leap in close to foes and land a devastating blow with a hardened fist.
Within dense forests, this Pokémon lives in a pack with others of its kind. It's incredibly aggressive, and the other Pokémon of the forest fear it.
This Pokémon is a cluster of electrical energy. It’s said that removing the rings on Regieleki’s body will unleash the Pokémon’s latent power.
An academic theory proposes that Regidrago’s arms were once the head of an ancient dragon Pokémon. The theory remains unproven.
Glastrier emits intense cold from its hooves. It’s also a belligerent Pokémon—anything it wants, it takes by force.
It probes its surroundings with all its senses save one—it doesn’t use its sense of sight. Spectrier’s kicks are said to separate soul from body.
Calyrex is a merciful Pokémon, capable of providing healing and blessings. It reigned over the Galar region in times of yore.
According to lore, this Pokémon showed no mercy to those who got in its way, yet it would heal its opponents’ wounds after battle.
It’s said that Calyrex and a Pokémon that had bonded with it ran all across the Galar region to bring green to the wastelands.
The black orbs shine with an uncanny light when the Pokémon is erecting invisible barriers. The fur shed from its beard retains heat well and is a highly useful material for winter clothing.
A violent creature that fells towering trees with its crude axes and shields itself with hard stone. If one should chance upon this Pokémon in the wilds, one’s only recourse is to flee.
I believe it was Hisui’s swampy terrain that gave Ursaluna its burly physique and newfound capacity to manipulate peat at will.
Clads itself in the souls of comrades that perished before fulfilling their goals of journeying upstream. No other species throughout all Hisui’s rivers is Basculegion’s equal.
Because of Sneasler’s virulent poison and daunting physical prowess, no other species could hope to best it on the frozen highlands. Preferring solitude, this species does not form packs.
Its lancelike spikes and savage temperament have earned it the nickname “sea fiend.” It slurps up poison to nourish itself.
When it flies to this land from across the sea, the bitter winter comes to an end. According to legend, this Pokémon’s love gives rise to the budding of fresh life across Hisui.
A different guise from its feminine humanoid form. From the clouds, it descends upon those who treat any form of life with disrespect and metes out wrathful, ruthless punishment.
This Pokémon was born from passion that seeped into a coin. It wanders, apparently seeking to return to the treasure chest it once inhabited.
Its body seems to be made up of 1,000 coins. This Pokémon gets along well with others and is quick to make friends with anybody.
In order to support its flower, which has grown larger due to Mega Evolution, its back and legs have become stronger.
The overwhelming power that fills its entire body causes it to turn black and creates intense blue flames.
Its bond with its Trainer is the source of its power. It boasts speed and maneuverability greater than that of a jet fighter.
The cannon on its back is as powerful as a tank gun. Its tough legs and back enable it to withstand the recoil from firing the cannon.
Its legs have become poison stingers. It stabs its prey repeatedly with the stingers on its limbs, dealing the final blow with the stinger on its rear.
With its muscular strength now greatly increased, it can fly continuously for two weeks without resting.
Having traded away its muscles, Alakazam's true power has been unleashed. With its psychic powers, it can foresee all things.
Having been swallowed whole by Shellder, Slowbro now has an iron defense. It's pretty comfortable in there, too.
Mega Evolution has made it possible for Gengar to access other dimensions. Its entire body is brimming with strange power.
When the mother sees the back of her Mega-Evolved child, it makes her think of the day when her child will inevitably leave her.
After Mega Evolution, it becomes able to fly. Perhaps because it's so happy, it rarely touches the ground.
It zooms out of the water at Mach speeds. Even large ships caught in its path are split cleanly in two!
Mega Evolution awakened some dormant genes, bringing back the sharp rocks that once covered Aerodactyl's entire body.
Psychic power has augmented its muscles. It has a grip strength of one ton and can sprint a hundred meters in two seconds flat!
Despite its diminished size, its mental power has grown phenomenally. With a mere thought, it can smash a skyscraper to smithereens.
Massive amounts of energy intensely stimulated Ampharos's cells, apparently awakening its long-sleeping dragon's blood.
Steelix lives even further underground than Onix. This Pokémon is known to dig toward the earth's core. There are records of this Pokémon reaching a depth of over six-tenths of a mile underground.
It stores the excess energy from Mega Evolution, so after a long time passes, its body starts to melt.
It can grip things with its two horns and lift 500 times its own body weight.
Houndoom's entire body generates heat when it Mega Evolves. Its fearsome fiery breath turns its opponents to ash.
The effects of Mega Evolution make it more ferocious than ever. It's unclear whether it can even hear its Trainer's orders.
The leaves growing on Sceptile's body are very sharp edged. This Pokémon is very agile—it leaps all over the branches of trees and jumps on its foe from above or behind.
In battle, Blaziken blows out intense flames from its wrists and attacks foes courageously. The stronger the foe, the more intensely this Pokémon's wrists burn.
Swampert is very strong. It has enough power to easily drag a boulder weighing more than a ton. This Pokémon also has powerful vision that lets it see even in murky water.
Gardevoir has the ability to read the future. If it senses impending danger to its Trainer, this Pokémon is said to unleash its psychokinetic energy at full power.
It blocks any and all attacks with its giant-sized gemstone. However, the stone's a heavy burden, and it limits Mega Sableye's movements.
Its two sets of jaws thrash about violently as if they each had a will of their own. One gnash from them can turn a boulder to dust.
Aggron claims an entire mountain as its own territory. It mercilessly beats up anything that violates its environment. This Pokémon vigilantly patrols its territory at all times.
It is said that through meditation, Medicham heightens energy inside its body and sharpens its sixth sense. This Pokémon hides its presence by merging itself with fields and mountains.
Too much electricity has built up in its body, irritating Manectric. Its explosive speed is equal to that of a lightning bolt.
The moment it charges into its opponent, sharp spikes pop out of Sharpedo's head, leaving its opponent with deep wounds.
Camerupt has a volcano inside its body. Magma of 18,000 degrees Fahrenheit courses through its body. Occasionally, the humps on this Pokémon's back erupt, spewing the superheated magma.
Altaria dances and wheels through the sky among billowing, cotton-like clouds. By singing melodies in its crystal-clear voice, this Pokémon makes its listeners experience dreamy wonderment.
Mega Evolution increases its vindictiveness, and the cursing power that was held back by its zipper comes spilling out.
Normally, it dislikes fighting, so it really hates changing to this form for battles.
When it spews stupendously cold air from its broken mouth, the entire area around it gets whited out.
It puts its forelegs inside its shell to streamline itself for flight. Salamence flies at high speeds over all kinds of topographical features.
Its intellect surpasses its previous level, resulting in battles so cruel, they'll make you want to cover your eyes.
Latias is highly sensitive to the emotions of people. If it senses any hostility, this Pokémon ruffles the feathers all over its body and cries shrilly to intimidate the foe.
Latios has the ability to make others see an image of what it has seen or imagines in its head. This Pokémon is intelligent and understands human speech.
Through Primal Reversion and with nature's full power, it will take back its true form. It can summon storms that cause the sea levels to rise.
Groudon is said to be the personification of the land itself. Legends tell of its many clashes against Kyogre, as each sought to gain the power of nature.
Rayquaza is said to have lived for hundreds of millions of years. Legends remain of how it put to rest the clash between Kyogre and Groudon.
Mega Evolution awakens its combative instincts. It has shed any fur that got in the way of its attacks.
Its arms and wings melted into something like scythes. Mad with rage, it rampages on and on.
Its aura has expanded due to Mega Evolution. Governed only by its combative instincts, it strikes enemies without mercy.
It blankets wide areas in snow by whipping up blizzards. It is also known as "The Ice Monster."
Because it can sense what its foe is thinking, its attacks burst out first, fast, and fierce.
Using the feelers on its ears, it can tell how someone is feeling or when an egg might hatch.
A sudden transformation of Carbink, its pink, glimmering body is said to be the loveliest sight in the whole world.

%PLAYERNAME%! There you are! How’ve you been feeling?
I ask because I’m a bit out of sorts. The temperature’s been fluctuating between brisk and balmy all day, and the local plant life has been uncharacteristically productive.
There were Pinap Berry seeds in the pocket of my spare coat, and they started sprouting overnight! And that’s to say nothing of the tree growing through my bed. Makes it hard to saw logs, if you’ll excuse the pun.
But there’s more. A tremor shook the lab earlier. It rattled the Daily Adventure Incense I was preparing for you right off the table!
It all suggests the natural forces around us are somehow overactive.
Now that you’re here, I think we can get a handle on the situation. Things don’t look serious yet, but we should prepare for any possibility—call it a professor’s intuition!
Let’s check on how the weather’s affecting the local Pokémon. See if you can find any clues, will you? 
(Come to think of it, the team leaders and I wished on one of those shooting stars the other day for the earth and sea to flourish. It couldn’t be...could it?)
Good to see you back, %PLAYERNAME%! Seems like you didn’t run into any trouble. Unfortunately, I can’t say the same—things have gone from bad to worse here.
I felt another tremor earlier, followed by a sudden downpour. My notes were nearly washed away!
Enough about that, though. Let’s take a look at what you’ve found. Hmm... Ground-type and Water-type Pokémon... And when we take into account the climatic conditions, strange tectonic activity, and rapidly flourishing plant life...
The only word I can think of to describe this phenomenon is “primal”!
When there’s an overabundance of natural energy, the Pokémon Kyogre and Groudon can absorb that energy to revert to their primal forms, dramatically increasing their power.
Some even say those are their true forms. As a professor, of course I’d love to study them up close! But Pokémon that mighty can sow chaos if left unchecked for long.
But don’t worry, %PLAYERNAME%. I’ve sent the team leaders and Rhi on a mission to find the Red and Blue Orbs. According to the literature of the Hoenn region, the orbs are ancient artifacts with the power to calm Primal Kyogre and Primal Groudon.
Once Primal Groudon and Primal Kyogre are subdued, everything should go back to normal. Until then, stay safe!

Primal Reversion is an ancient transformation some Pokémon can undergo. Like Mega Evolution, Primal Reversion provides bonuses, is not permanent, and requires special energy. It also provides more benefits in battle than Mega Evolution does.
Primal Reversion
Pokémon that have undergone Primal Reversion bring special weather effects to Raid Battles.• Primal Kyogre boosts Water-, Electric-, and Bug-type attacks.• Primal Groudon boosts Fire-, Grass-, and Ground-type attacks.

Game Specific Disclosures<br><br>Additional Privacy Information for Pokémon GO<br><br>Pokémon Trainer Club Accounts. You can sign up for Pokémon GO using your third-party Pokémon Trainer Club (“PTC”) account administered by The Pokémon Company International (“TPCI”). If you choose to do so, we will collect from TPCI your PTC registered email address, your PTC username and a unique PTC user ID. If you are registering your PTC account on behalf of your authorized child we will also collect some Personal Data about your child. See the “Accounts with Children” paragraph below for more information.<br><br>Accounts with Children. We comply with parental consent requirements as mandated by the U.S. Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and European data protection laws (including, without limitation, the General Data Protection Regulation) through a verification and consent process handled by TPCI. As described in the Pokémon GO Terms of Service, the parent or legal guardian (“Parent”) of each child under the age of 13, or in the EEA 16 or the age needed to consent to the processing of personal data (“Child”), must register with TPCI through a PTC account before their Child can access and use the game. The Parent will have to provide to TPCI certain Personal Data about the Child in accordance with the TPCI privacy policy. Of that, Niantic will only collect from TPCI the Child’s personal email address, and the date when the Child will grow out of the age limits listed above.<br><br>For U.S. residents, after a Parent has registered a PTC account, TPCI will verify the Parent’s identity by asking for the sum of the first and last digits of the Parent’s social security number and the Parent’s name, date of birth, and street address. TPCI will not share that information with us. After TPCI verifies the Parent’s identity, it will ask the Parent to consent to the Child accessing Pokémon GO. If a Parent does not consent to a Child’s access to and use of Pokémon GO or does not verify their identity through the consent process, Niantic will bar that Child’s registration on Pokémon GO and prevent the Child’s access to and use of the game.<br><br>Parents have the right to refuse further collection, use, and/or disclosure of their Child’s Personal Data by notifying us. As a Parent, you understand that Niantic has a legitimate interest in providing your Child’s information collected via the Services to third party providers for the sole purpose of administering or providing the Services, as described in Paragraph 3 of this Privacy Policy.<br><br>Information shared with other players. When you take certain actions in Pokémon GO and capture a Gym, your (or your authorized Child’s) username will be shared publicly through the game, including with other players, in connection with that Gym location.<br><br>Apple Watch and Apple Health App Data.

You have arrived at an opportune moment, Pokémon Trainer. While searching for clues to your professor’s whereabouts, I uncovered an odd device among his belongings.
This contraption appears similar to your Incense, but the color and scent are distinctive.
You have not seen this before either? I see.
Perhaps it is an entirely new invention.
Affixed to it were several notes, though I have not read them all.
If you take the device, then I will examine what is written.
Please give me some moments.
The notes were indeed enlightening, Pokémon Trainer. Your professor calls this device “Daily Adventure Incense.”
Upon activation, it will attract Pokémon to your location for 15 minutes—so long as you are moving.
The professor has arranged that one be made available to you each day. His writings indicate a sincere hope that this invention will facilitate new friendships and adventures.
What rare components must this device contain?
... ... ...
Let us activate it and see what happens.
Thank you for the demonstration, Pokémon Trainer.
I see potential in this device.
It appears to attract a slightly different variety of Pokémon than what one would expect to encounter.
How clever.
The professor’s creativity and thoughtfulness is admirable.
I eagerly anticipate the day I meet him. The tools of this world are fascinating, but the people...even more so.
%PLAYERNAME%! Perfect timing. I’ve been testing a new type of Incense that I can’t wait for you to try. I call it—Daily Adventure Incense!
You’ll notice that aside from its color, it smells a bit different from the Incense you’re familiar with. But that’s not all!
It also—whoops! Listen to me ramble. I know you’re busy as a Combee. When you’ve got more time, come back and I’ll show you how it works.
Ah, %PLAYERNAME%, you’re back! Now let me teach you how to use Daily Adventure Incense.
You can activate this unique Incense while you’re out and about to attract a slightly different variety of Pokémon than what you might expect to encounter.
It only lasts for 15 minutes, but don’t worry—I’ll make sure to fix you up with a new one each day.
Daily Adventure Incense works best when you’re actively moving, so it’s best not to use it while you’re taking a break.
Excited? Me too! Now let’s give it a whirl, %PLAYERNAME%!
I see you’ve made some new Pokémon friends already, %PLAYERNAME%. Let’s have a look!
Hm...
Very interesting.
Some of these Pokémon aren’t usually seen around here. Pretty neat, huh?
Thanks for trying out Daily Adventure Incense. Who knows—if you keep using it, you might end up seeing something legendary!
Take care, %PLAYERNAME%. I’ll see you again soon!
Great to see you again, %PLAYERNAME%. I always run into you when I find something exciting. Maybe you’re my Special Research good-luck charm!
Last night, I was studying the chemical reaction that causes Trubbish to appear.
Suddenly I saw bright flashing lights in the near distance and went to investigate.
When I arrived at the site, I noticed a lot of damage to the ground and the surrounding area.
At first, the damage looked to be caused by Trainers practicing for the GO Battle League, but my gut told me to investigate further in the morning.
While I look into this, can you help me research Normal-type Pokémon? Some of the damage looks like it was caused by a Normal-type attack.
Thanks for getting that baseline research taken care of for me, %PLAYERNAME%. I have some updates to share with you.
After I returned to the site we’re studying, I realized there was actually a trail of damage.
When I followed that trail, I started finding areas that were clearly burned.
That damage must have been done by a Fire-type Pokémon—or at least a Pokémon that knows Fire-type attacks.
You know what this means, Trainer! Time to research Fire-type Pokémon.
The more information we have about this type of Pokémon, the more clues we’ll have to determine whatever did all this damage.
Meanwhile, I’ll continue following the trail of damage.
Thanks, %PLAYERNAME%! You’ve been on fire when it comes to getting these research tasks done! Get it? You’re on fire?
Anyway...the damage can’t have been caused by a Trainer Battle. I’ve never seen anything like it before. It seems almost...unnatural?
Could it really have been caused by Pokémon? This is getting fascinating! Could you do some research on Water-type Pokémon for me?
As I followed the damage trail further, the burned area suddenly ended and strange water damage started appearing, and it just doesn’t seem to line up with any Pokémon I’ve encountered.
%PLAYERNAME%, I’m so glad you’re back! We might have stumbled upon something incredible.
I contacted one of my colleagues in the Unova region.
She shared some notes about a Mythical Pokémon called Genesect that was restored from a 300-million-year-old fossil and then altered.
Pretty cool, huh? The notes say that though this Pokémon is Bug and Steel type, it’s known to be able to use attacks with types like Fire and Water, among others.
This lines up with the damage at the site we’ve been researching!
One of the other types Genesect can attack with is Electric, and as I kept following the damage trail, I found spots that must have been hit by some kind of high-voltage Electric-type attack.
I’ll see if anything else lies even farther down the trail, but in the meantime, I know I can count on you to start investigating Electric-type Pokémon to help us get to the bottom of this.
I can’t thank you enough for your help, %PLAYERNAME%. You really are my Special Research good-luck charm!
With the information you collected combined with the notes from Unova, I think we’ve uncovered the Bug- and Steel-type Pokémon Genesect!
I know what you’re thinking: Bug AND Steel with such odd attack types?
Apparently, when this Pokémon is holding a specially developed item called a Drive, its Techno Blast attack changes to a type that corresponds to the Drive the Pokémon’s holding.
I wonder what kinds of Drives exist for this Pokémon.
I still have so many questions, but for now, why not do a little research on Ice-type Pokémon? I hear Ice is another type Genesect can wield.
You ought to take a snapshot of Genesect to commemorate your meeting, too!
Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%. Good to see you again. Your research inspired me to do some more research of my own, and I think I’ve come across something...groundbreaking.
I was investigating the digging patterns of Diglett, and I wound up heading deep into a cave. Inside, I came across some unusual markings carved heavily into the cavern walls.
At first, I thought them to be random, but then I realized the carvings formed four unique patterns, each consisting of seven circles.
These patterns look incredibly familiar, and I think we need to take a closer look at some Pokémon in particular.
Can I count on you to help me research some Rock-type Pokémon?  I have a hunch that this will lead us to our first clue.
Simply amazing! The pattern on the Regirock you caught matches perfectly with the first pattern of carvings on the cave walls.
This leads me to believe we should move our investigation to Ice-type Pokémon. I wonder if we’ll find another Pokémon that will help us solve this puzzle.
I have one in mind, but I don’t want to get ahead of myself!
I’m sure with the help of an accomplished Trainer such as yourself, we’ll be on our way to figuring this out in no time.
As expected, Regice clearly has similar markings to the second carving I found in the cave.
I remember an ancient legend that told a story about a Colossal Pokémon. It’s said that it made Pokémon that looked like itself from a special ice mountain, rocks, and magma.
Could it be these Pokémon these patterns originate from? This is starting to get exciting, isn’t it?
If the first two Pokémon were Regirock and Regice...then there’s only one left that we must research further.
Excellent work. I believe we’re going in the right direction. This could only mean one thing, %PLAYERNAME%.
We’re close to coming across the Legendary Pokémon Regigigas! According to legend, this Pokémon towed continents with rope.
Maybe it can help move my research lab next time it gets stuck. Hahaha!
Anyway...I have a feeling that once you fully document these amazing creatures, you’ll make a colossal discovery of your own.
Welcome to GO Fest 2019, %PLAYERNAME%! I’m glad you’re here.
I discovered something fascinating during my research, and I need your help. I’ve come across what I believe to be a rare Pokémon deep in slumber.
We have our work cut out for us, %PLAYERNAME%. I think this adventure is going to call for some resources and even the help of some friends.
Could you collect some supplies? Meanwhile, I’ll see if I can find anything about this Pokémon in any of my texts.
Good work, %PLAYERNAME%. I’m sure the resources you’ve earned will be crucial.
I had some success in my research, as well. I came across an ancient text containing the story of a Mythical Pokémon that grants wishes.
I’m still researching the best way to awaken this Pokémon, but I keep hearing reports of other Pokémon in the area showing signs of distress.
Could I ask you to investigate these reports?
Well done, %PLAYERNAME%! I knew I could count on you. You know, something interesting came up when I reviewed your results.
Many of the Pokémon you encountered seem to have strayed from their habitats.
I’d like you to help them get back to their proper habitats, as I’m sure this will soothe them and make them more comfortable. This should be a breeze for an accomplished Trainer like you!
As you return the Pokémon to their proper habitats, be sure to snap pictures to help document this unusual situation.
Wonderful work, %PLAYERNAME%! You’re certainly getting the hang of that camera! Did you notice anything strange while taking photos of Pokémon in their habitats?
Apparently there’s an unusual phenomenon where Pokémon leap out in an attempt to appear in your photos. I’ve heard Spark refer to it as a “photobomb.”
I’m eternally amused—and amazed—by the things we learn about Pokémon every day. That said, I did notice a connection.
These Pokémon all seem to have something in common—music! I have a hunch that music may be the key to awakening our slumbering Pokémon.
What do you think, %PLAYERNAME%? Shall we set the stage and see if some beautiful music is the answer to this perplexing situation?
That’s it! The pure melody created by your musical Pokémon has awakened the Steel- and Psychic-type Pokémon Jirachi!
The ancient text was right—this Mythical Pokémon could only be awakened from its thousand-year slumber by a song of purity. The text also says that when Jirachi awakens, it grants wishes!
Now that we’ve done the work of waking Jirachi up, I wonder what you and your fellow Trainers will wish for. I already know what my wish is going to be—I want you to enjoy this amazing experience!
It isn’t every day that you get to join Trainers from all over the world in exploring a park with so many Pokémon in such diverse habitats—not to mention meeting a Mythical Pokémon!
I’m sure Jirachi was far from the last amazing discovery to be made, though. I’ll no doubt be calling on your excellent research skills again in the future!
Nice to see you again, %PLAYERNAME%! I’m excited to get started on our next big adventure.
What do we need to do? Well, I’ve come across something amazing, and I need your help.
We’re going to focus our efforts on Pokémon originally discovered in the Hoenn region, because I have some leads on a Pokémon I’ve never seen before!
First, we need to get some baseline research to help track this Pokémon.
Can you explore the area? Who knows—you might make some friends along the way.
Great job, Trainer. Your work helped me get a better understanding of the search area for this mysterious Pokémon. I can’t wait to show you what I’ve been working on.
A few weeks ago, I came across an ancient text that was found in the Hoenn region. It was filled with fascinating information.
It mentions a Mythical Pokémon that awakens once every thousand years and has the ability to grant wishes!
I really want to get a deeper understanding of this text, and how better to do that than with some research? Can you help me collect some information on Pokémon from the Hoenn region?
Thanks for your help, %PLAYERNAME%. Your Hoenn Pokédex is really looking great!
The Whismur you caught reminded me of a line from the text I told you about. It mentioned that a melody or a sound can awaken a sleeping Pokémon.
That gives me an idea... Let’s do a little experiment. There’s a sleeping Snorlax that hasn’t left my lab in months. And it’s right in front of my Berry stash!
Think we could wake it up with a loud noise? Let’s document the Whismur Evolution line, too—some photos will do.
Wow! That sure was loud, but it did the trick! Loudred worked just like an alarm clock for poor Snorlax.
I should make up for the rude awakening with some Berries... Well, we’ve learned something important here, and I think this method could work to awaken even the deepest of sleepers.
If my calculations are correct, the wish-granting Mythical Pokémon might be ready to awaken soon, and we should be prepared to do the waking!
The text says that the Pokémon is a Steel and Psychic type, so I think a good next step is to catch a few Pokémon with similar characteristics.
We’ll need a few extra hands to get this done, too. Could you get some fellow Trainers to help out?
Good work, %PLAYERNAME%. With the help of your research, I’ve been able to decipher more of this ancient text.
It says that when the Mythical Pokémon awakens, it will grant any wishes written on notes attached to its head.
Another interesting tidbit: If this Pokémon senses danger, it will fight without awakening. Up for a Trainer Battle, %PLAYERNAME%?
If the battle causes any reactions nearby, I have sensors set up to detect them. It might seem like a long shot, but I have a good feeling about this!
It worked! I’m picking up some vibrations nearby. I think we’re on the right track.
Maybe the Mythical Pokémon is close to awakening. Since what we’re doing is working, let’s keep it up.
We need to pull out all the stops, though, and the timing has to be just right.
I’ll hold things down here with Loudred while you keep focusing on encountering Steel- and Psychic-type Pokémon.
If you can do that, I think it’ll help the Mythical Pokémon see that you’re a worthy Trainer!
Simply astonishing! We encountered the Steel- and Psychic-type Pokémon Jirachi!
That was a once-in-a-lifetime experience. Well, once in several lifetimes, if Jirachi truly only wakes once every thousand years.
You’ve become such an accomplished Trainer, %PLAYERNAME%. Thank you for going on this amazing adventure with me.
You can bet I’ll be in touch whenever another exciting research project comes up. Until then, let’s get out there and GO!
How was 2019 for you, %PLAYERNAME%? For me, it was a fantastic year, and I want to thank you and all our Trainers around the world for your hard work.
Together, we took on Team GO Rocket, uncovered the Wish Pokémon, Jirachi, and began encountering Pokémon originally discovered in Unova.
I want to make sure you know how proud I am of how much you and all the other Trainers have grown this last year!
And now with 2020 on the horizon, there are sure to be many more adventures awaiting! Until then, let’s get up and GO!

Strange Rings
Strange Rings (1/2)
Strange Rings (2/2)
Ah, %PLAYERNAME%! Just the Trainer I was hoping to see. Have you been enjoying the festival?
I was just out on a stroll and witnessed the most incredible sight. Several rings had appeared in the sky, and as I stared up at them, something truly remarkable occurred.
Legendary Pokémon began emerging from the rings as if by magic!
Naturally, I rushed back to my laboratory and began frantically searching through every book I thought might shed some light on what had happened—but I’ve yet to find anything.
I’m going to keep looking, but in the meantime, I could really use your help investigating in the field.
We have to find out what’s going on here!
Thanks for collecting that information, Trainer. I’m going to send it over to Blanche for analysis. Unfortunately, the rings in the sky have yet to disappear.
I did have some luck in my search for an explanation, however. Look here—it’s the Mythical Pokémon Hoopa.
Known as the Mischief Pokémon, Hoopa enjoys sending things to faraway places using its rings, which can warp space.
That explains why those Legendary Pokémon appeared the way they did. Hoopa uses those rings to move things from place to place—including itself. It won’t be easy to catch.
Based on reports from the team leaders, it doesn’t seem like Hoopa is in the area at the moment. Let’s use this time to prepare to catch it, hm?
Mischievous though Hoopa may be, you have to admit that its rings are quite fascinating, eh, %PLAYERNAME%?
Moments like this remind me of why I became a Pokémon Professor in the first place. The world of Pokémon is endlessly exciting!
For now, why don’t you go challenge some raids with other Trainers and catch some Pokémon? You’ll need your skills at their sharpest to catch Hoopa. Now, let’s GO!

The music was so boisterous that Meloetta not only came to listen, but actually joined the performance! I’d call that a success.
Pikachu, Galarian Zigzagoon, and Gardevoir—your band is assembled and ready for a boisterous performance!
The music was so cheerful that Meloetta not only came to listen, but actually joined the performance! I’d call that a success.
Pikachu, Galarian Ponyta, and Gardevoir—your band is assembled and ready for a cheerful performance!
The music was so stylish that Meloetta not only came to listen, but actually joined the performance! I’d call that a success.
Pikachu, Galarian Ponyta, and Flygon—your band is assembled and ready for a stylish performance!
The music was so emotional that Meloetta not only came to listen, but actually joined the performance! I’d call that a success.
Excellent choice, %PLAYERNAME%!
Gardevoir is a fascinating Pokémon. Did you know it can read the future? I bet it can tell we’re about to witness a performance for the ages!
Gardevoir probably needs a few moments to do a sound check. Have to make sure those levels are all where they should be!
Why don’t you let Blanche— Oh, no.
Pikachu, Galarian Zigzagoon, and Gardevoir—your band is assembled and ready for an emotional performance!
What an amazing performance, %PLAYERNAME%! The Pokémon you gathered for your band really know how to rock out!
The music was so energetic that Meloetta not only came to listen, but actually joined the performance! I’d call that a success.
You should feel incredibly proud of what you’ve accomplished today, Trainer. Or should I say...Director? Haha!
Now, get out there and enjoy the festivities! Until next time—let’s GO!
Excellent choice, %PLAYERNAME%!
Flygon has a distinct look, with red covers that shield its eyes from sand—but did you know that the flapping of its wings sounds almost like singing?
I can’t wait to hear what sort of dynamic it brings to the band’s sound!
Flygon probably needs a few moments to get warmed up. Why don’t you let Blanche— Oh, no.
Looks like Team GO Rocket is trying to disrupt the celebrations! Must they really try to ruin everything?
Sorry to interrupt your preparations, Director, but it looks like we’ll be needing your battling skills today as well. Let’s power up and evolve some Pokémon to prepare!
We can’t let some troublemakers spoil everyone’s hard work!
Great job taking care of those Grunts, %PLAYERNAME%!
Pikachu, Galarian Zigzagoon, and Flygon—your band is assembled and ready for an energetic performance!
Candela has been working closely with the events team to make sure everything is perfect. The staging and decorations are going to blow you away!
I believe all we need now is an audience.
Why don’t you go spread the word about the show? It’s bound to appeal to people and Pokémon alike!
Wow, this turnout is incredible, %PLAYERNAME%!
You really have a knack for making friends—the crowd is full of people and Pokémon here to support you!
In fact, I’ve been hearing reports of a Mythical Pokémon that’s been spotted nearby. I bet it wants to join the festivities, too!
It’s known as the Melody Pokémon, and the melodies it sings have inspired many famous songs.
That’s all I’ll share for now—I’m sure that Pokémon will introduce itself if it decides to swing by!
All we can do now is sit back and enjoy the music.
The music was so extravagant that Meloetta not only came to listen, but actually joined the performance! I’d call that a success.
Pikachu, Galarian Ponyta, and Gardevoir—your band is assembled and ready for an extravagant performance!
What an amazing performance, %PLAYERNAME%! The Pokémon you gathered for your band are true pop stars.
The music was so lively that Meloetta not only came to listen, but actually joined the performance! I’d call that a success.
Pikachu, Galarian Zigzagoon, and Flygon—your band is assembled and ready for a lively performance!
Welcome to Pokémon GO Fest 2021, %PLAYERNAME%! Everyone seems pretty excited for this year’s event—Trainers and Pokémon alike!
Isn’t it lovely that when we have a good time, our Pokémon do, too? The good vibes go round and round.
Now that you’re here, I actually have an important job I need your help with. Pardon the short notice, but I think you’ll really enjoy it!
What you see around you is the makings of a music festival. We’re still getting things set up, but that’ll speed up a bit now that the show’s director is here—that’s you!
I’ve got some things to prep before you get started, so why not take your buddy out for a stroll and enjoy the festivities for a while? You might even make a few more Pokémon friends along the way.
The theme of this year’s Pokémon GO Fest is music, so let’s try our best to put on a good show! The team leaders are hard at work setting up a top-class stage.
With a director like you, I know we’re in for a performance we won’t soon forget.
But for that, you’ll need a talented act! And with that in mind, there’s a certain Pikachu backstage that’s buzzing to meet you.
It’s got makeup and wardrobe standing by to help tailor its look to match your vision for the festival. Do you think you’d rather put on a rock show or a pop show?
Pikachu’s ready to dazzle either way, so it’s really up to you! For now, I’d suggest you go for a stroll and give your decision some thought. Maybe you could pick a genre that matches one of your favorite songs?
Fabulous choice, %PLAYERNAME%! The glitter, the glam—Pikachu looks ready to electrify the crowd!
There’s still lots of prep to take care of before the show, though.
Blanche is overseeing rehearsal, so let’s leave Pikachu to help out.
In the meantime, we need to find Pikachu some accompaniment.
While concert prep continues, think about which Pokémon you’d like backing up Pikachu on stage. I can’t wait to see your vision come to life!
Its cute presence is a great addition to Pikachu’s pop-star energy.
But before all that, I’d say Pikachu and Galarian Ponyta are going to need one last member to fill out the band.
Galarian Zigzagoon it is! A fierce choice. I’ll let the team leaders know so they can start getting everything in place for the show.
Did you know that Galarian Zigzagoon tends to be incredibly restless? That kind of boundless energy is sure to bring an exciting edge to the show!
A Pikachu onstage with a Galarian Zigzagoon sounds like a really fun show!
Rockin’ choice, %PLAYERNAME%! You know, there was a time when I dreamed of being in a rock band myself—but that’s a story for another time.
Now that you’ve chosen a theme for the show, Pikachu’s got a lot of prep to do before it takes the stage.
Blanche is overseeing rehearsal, so let’s leave Pikachu to help out. In the meantime, we need to find Pikachu some accompaniment.
I’ve already scouted a couple promising candidates: Galarian Ponyta and Galarian Zigzagoon. They’re both sporting festive headwear, so you really can’t go wrong!
While concert prep continues, think about which Pokémon you’d like backing up Pikachu on stage. I can’t wait to see your vision come to life!
Galarian Ponyta, eh? Wonderful choice, %PLAYERNAME%! I’ll let the team leaders know so they can start getting everything in place for the show.
Galarian Ponyta is known to look into your eyes and read the contents of your heart. If it finds evil there, it promptly hides away.
A calming presence like that is a great complement to Pikachu’s electric energy. Rock on!
Spark is in charge of choreography, so we can turn our attention elsewhere for the time being.
When your prancing Pokémon is ready, why not take a snapshot of it to commemorate the moment? So long as it doesn’t find any evil in your heart, that is. Haha!
But before all that, I’d say Pikachu and Galarian Ponyta are going to need one last member to fill out the band.
Galarian Zigzagoon it is! I’ll let the team leaders know so they can start getting everything in place for the show.
Did you know that Galarian Zigzagoon tends to be incredibly restless? That kind of energy is sure to keep the atmosphere rockin’!
I can’t wait to hear Pikachu and Galarian Zigzagoon bring the house down!
Spark is in charge of choreography, so we can turn our attention elsewhere for the time being.
When your zigzagging Pokémon is ready, why not take a snapshot of it to commemorate the moment? If you can get it to sit still, that is!
But before all that, I’d say Pikachu and Galarian Zigzagoon are going to need one last member to fill out the band.
Two Pokémon really wowed me during their auditions: Flygon and Gardevoir. Which do you prefer?
The music was so spirited that Meloetta not only came to listen, but actually joined the performance! I’d call that a success.
Pikachu, Galarian Ponyta, and Flygon—your band is assembled and ready for a spirited performance!

Do you... Do you think there’s a chance that other Trainers you’ve passed on the street were actually Ditto? I suppose there’s no way to know for sure...
What a confusing but educational day this has been, %PLAYERNAME%. I hope you’ve enjoyed the Transform Pokémon’s shenanigans! Now, until next time, ... ... ...!
Er...
%PLAYERNAME%? Is it really you?
Oh, thank goodness. I’ve had the most befuddling day.
The Pokémon in the area were behaving strangely, so, as always, I turned to you to help me find out why—but to my confusion, you just stared at me blankly and bit straight into a Nanab Berry!
The next thing I knew, “you” had transformed into a Ditto! Or perhaps I have that backwards? Whatever the case, it seems that all the oddly behaving Pokémon I’ve seen today were in fact Ditto in disguise.
Hm? You noticed it too, did you?
And you saw a Ditto that had transformed to look like me? Incredible!
As you’ve experienced, Ditto have the fascinating ability to reconstitute their entire cellular structure to transform into whatever they see.
%PLAYERNAME%! It’s...it’s...
It’s the Pidgey! They’ve flown the coop!
For years, Trainers like yourself have been sending me Pidgey to research.
I’ve kept each and every one safe and healthy, feeding them the best Berries, providing them with the softest nests...
But somehow they’ve escaped from my lab! Maybe this is what I get for using a Great Fence instead of an Ultra Fence.
*sigh* And after all the care I put into everyone’s Pidgey, too. We’ve got a real whirlwind of a situation on our hands!
On the bright side, this might make for a fascinating paper on the impact of the flighty flock on the local environment...
But first things first. Help me catch as many of these plucky Pidgey as you can, %PLAYERNAME%! Before they try to fly off with my whole trailer...or me!
%PLAYERNAME%? %PLAYERNAME%!
Phew! I was worried the Pidgey might’ve blown you away.
Most of the Pidgey are back safe in the lab, thanks to you and your fellow Trainers! I’m so glad it wasn’t a gust—er, bust.
Take these items for your help with today’s feathery fracas, %PLAYERNAME%.
I’ve put in an order for double the Pidgey’s usual amount of Berries, so let's hope they’ll feel pampered enough not to be a flight risk anymore.
That’s enough fun for one day, I’d say. Until next time!
Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! Isn’t it lovely out?
There are Litten lying in the sun, Rowlet relaxing in the trees, Popplio playing in the water—and these malasadas Spark dropped off sure are delicious!
It seems even the flowers smell sweeter today!
Why don’t you go out and see what Pokémon are around, %PLAYERNAME%? Maybe we’ll find something new to research!
I think I’ll sit this one out. Taking breaks is important!
Ah, you’re back already, %PLAYERNAME%—and with some new Pokémon in tow! Well done.
While you were gone, I noticed there’s something sparkling in the air today. Perhaps it’s a result of my radiant personality, eh, %PLAYERNAME%?
Haha! Seriously though, it’s something I’m looking into.
For now, let’s have a look at the Pokémon you’ve caught.
Hmm, how curious. You appear to have caught several Pokémon that are often found on Alola’s Akala Island.
Akala Island has some amazing geographical features that make it a suitable habitat for a wide range of Pokémon.
There’s Brooklet Hill, a fantastic fishing spot with a series of cascading waterfalls. And Lush Jungle, where trees grow densely together, as well as Wela Volcano Park—which, as you may have guessed, is a volcano!
How about keeping an eye out for Fire-, Water-, and Grass-type Pokémon while you’re out, %PLAYERNAME%? If my hunch is correct, you may run into more Pokémon often seen about Akala Island.
Well done, %PLAYERNAME%! That’s quite an assortment of Pokémon you’ve encountered.
I wish I’d been out there with you, but I wasn’t sitting idly by! I think I may have discovered why the air seems to be sparkling today.
You see, Blanche just reported witnessing a mysterious pink Pokémon behind a flower bush.
Based on its description, I believe Blanche may have seen Tapu Lele, the guardian deity of Akala Island.
The fragrant aroma of flowers is the source of Tapu Lele’s energy. Perhaps that has something to do with why the flowers smell so sweet today.
Spark and Blanche have both seen guardian deities now... Hmm. While I chew on that, let’s get out and look for Tapu Lele, %PLAYERNAME%!
Whew! That was a good walk. I just got back myself, %PLAYERNAME%.
I wasn’t able to find Tapu Lele, but I did manage to get a closer look at some of the sparkles I’ve been seeing in the air.
They appear to be the glowing scales Tapu Lele is known to scatter. Touching them is said to restore good health on the spot.
How did you fare during your investigation, %PLAYERNAME%?
*gasp* You saw Tapu Lele?! That’s incredible!
So, we’ve been visited by two of Alola’s guardian deities now... What could they be here for, I wonder?
Tapu Lele is said to be guilelessly cruel, so I do hope we’re staying on its good side.
If I could just meet one of the guardian deities myself, it would help me form a solid hypothesis as to why they’re appearing...
But that’s for me to ponder. Don’t trouble yourself with it—go out and enjoy the day! I’ll be in touch soon. Let’s GO!
%PLAYERNAME%! Wonderful to see you.
You may know this already, but some Pokémon have different forms depending on the region they appear in, like Geodude. In most places, Geodude are described as being very similar to rocks—so much so that many Trainers mistake them for boulders.
Uniquely, the Geodude found in Alola are Rock- and Electric-type, while the Geodude found in Kanto are Rock- and Ground-type. Fascinating, don't you think?
You know, if you accidentally step on an Alolan Geodude, you'll hear a crunching sound and feel a shock ripple through your entire body.
I’d read about this phenomenon some time ago, but I was, er, “lucky” enough to experience it myself earlier today. Suffice it to say it left me feeling electrified!
Why don’t you head out to find some Alolan Geodude for yourself? Just make sure to watch your step!
Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! I see you had no trouble finding Alolan Geodude.
When Alolan Geodude evolves into Alolan Graveler, it becomes even more impressive. Alolan Graveler’s food of choice is a mineral called dravite. After eating it, crystals form inside the Pokémon, rising to the surface in some parts of its body.
Oh! And this fact’s my favorite: When two Alolan Graveler clash, it fills the surrounding area with flashes of light and sound. People call it the “fireworks of the earth”!
You know, I’d really like to see Alolan Graveler for myself. Think you can help me out, %PLAYERNAME%?
Well done! That’s a mighty Alolan Graveler you’ve got there.
I’d love to see those “fireworks of the earth” for myself, but...maybe later. And much farther from my lab.
In any case! While you were away, I continued with some field research of my own. I saw the most curious thing—an Alolan Geodude flying through the air!
I suspect it was the work of Alolan Golem, the Evolution of Alolan Graveler. Alolan Golem can shoot large rocks that are charged with electricity. However, because it can’t fire boulders at a rapid pace, it’s been known to grab nearby Geodude and fire them instead.
Can you do some research to help me understand what I saw?
Ah, you’re back—and with an Alolan Golem!
Alolan Golem are known to be grumpy and stubborn. If you upset them, they discharge electricity from the surface of their bodies and let out a growl that sounds like thunder.
Between that and their penchant for launching Geodude in lieu of boulders, we’d best be careful around Alolan Golem.
You have an incredible knack for befriending Pokémon, though, so I’m sure you’ll be the best of pals in no time!
Thanks for assisting me with my research today, %PLAYERNAME%. It always “rocks” to have your help! Heh heh... See you next time!
Good to see you again, %PLAYERNAME%. Have you noticed an increased number of Abra in the area?
Yes, so did I. I originally thought this strange phenomenon was happening due to Abra’s ability to teleport.
When Abra decides to teleport randomly, it creates the illusion that it’s made copies of itself.
However, what’s happening right now really does seem to be a large number of Abra appearing in the wild! Let’s research more about Abra and see what we can discover about the Psi Pokémon!
Fantastic work, %PLAYERNAME%! Are you having difficulty catching Abra you encounter?
It’s said that you must clear your mind if you want to catch an Abra.
Or maybe you could ask your buddy for some catching assistance!
I’ve got a few more things about Abra that I could use your help researching. How about you give me a hand, and I’ll see if I can find a nice treat for your buddy?
I’m sure your buddy appreciates that delicious Poffin! I’m more of a Pinap Berry man myself.
While researching Abra, I read that it can sense danger and maintains a telepathic radar even while it’s sleeping! What amazing abilities!
Why don’t you keep researching? As a token of my thanks, I’ll give you one of the Rocket Radars I’ve developed.
While it won’t give you Abra’s ability to sense danger while sleeping, it will help you track down any trouble the Team GO Rocket Leaders are stirring up.
Thank you again, %PLAYERNAME%, for all your help today. It was incredible researching Abra with you.
We learned so much about this Psychic-type Pokémon. Rumor has it that some lucky Trainers even encountered Shiny Abra in the wild!
Pokémon are truly amazing creatures. There’s always something to discover.
Until next time, %PLAYERNAME%!
Hello, %PLAYERNAME%! I’ve got something for you to sink your teeth into.
Have you noticed the peculiar marks on the trees and boulders in the area? And the crushed berries on the ground?
While I’m a little disappointed in today’s Pinap Berry harvest, I’ve got a feeling that a Pokémon is responsible—and that means we have something to research!
And I’ll bet you even have an idea what Pokémon we’ll be investigating!
Why don’t you search the area and let me know what you find?
Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%.
Aha! So Axew are responsible for those unique marks and crushed berries.
These Pokémon play with each other by knocking their large tusks together. Crushing berries is how they test each other’s strength.
Axew tusks are sharp enough that people long ago used them as cooking knives!
These Pokémon find culinary uses for their tusks in the wild, too.
Fraxure, Axew’s Evolution, uses its thick tusks to neatly cut prey into two portions—one to eat now and one to save for later.
Fascinating, isn’t it? I wish I had that kind of restraint!
Why don’t you try evolving one of your Axew? Maybe I can get some tips for my meal prepping!
Look at this fine Fraxure, %PLAYERNAME%!
Now that you’ve got one of your own, here are a few more Fraxure facts.
Their territory battles can be intensely violent, and their tusks can shatter rocks.
But the tusks don’t grow back once they break, so Fraxure won’t use them unless truly necessary.
Even so, getting up close to one has me on edge—not unlike the sharp edges of their tusks!
Haha!
No? Ah well. So much for my sharp wit.
Anyway, it’s a good thing that Haxorus, Fraxure’s Evolution, has a kind disposition.
Why don’t you evolve Fraxure so we can see for ourselves?
Your Haxorus’s tusks are positively gleaming!
Or should I say beaming? Those sturdy tusks can cut steel beams and stay sharp! Haxorus are covered in great armor, too.
They’re docile, but they’ll become incredibly angry if their tusks are touched. Understandable—both Pokémon and people have different sensitivities.
Some of us are huggers, like me and Spark! But Blanche, ah, isn’t.
Nothing’s wrong with either, of course! It’s all part of what makes each person, and Pokémon, unique.
Thanks for spending the day with me, %PLAYERNAME%. I’ll see you again soon!
Where will you focus your efforts, Pokémon Trainer?
Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! Just who I wanted to see. I just received a unique research request regarding a particular Pokémon, and I think you’re the perfect Trainer to help me with it.
Let’s warm up with a few tasks first, and then we can dive into the meat of it!
Welcome back, Trainer. I have a few more details to share about the research request I received.
A favorite of new and experienced Trainers alike, Bidoof, the Plump Mouse Pokémon, has been appearing more often of late. Intriguing, no?
Now, before we continue, I have a very important choice for you to make. Will you focus your research on Bidoof or the Plump Mouse Pokémon?
Is this a trick question? Who could say! My only advice is to follow your heart. Besides, it’s hard to go wrong when Bidoof is your only option!
Great choice, Trainer! For some reason, I just knew you’d pick Bidoof. Don’t ask me how!
Bidoof is known for its two large front teeth. Much like Rattata’s teeth, Bidoof’s teeth are continually growing.
Speaking of teeth, I have a few tasks that you can sink yours into now!
Wonderful choice, Trainer! I had a feeling you’d pick the Plump Mouse Pokémon. Don’t ask me why!
Otherwise known as Bidoof, this Normal-type Pokémon is far from ordinary! While only about a foot tall, Bidoof is powerful. It can chew through boulders with its incisors—a feat that makes my jaw hurt to even think about.
Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%. Hopefully you got a few good snapshots of Bidoof while conducting your research! I always enjoy seeing the snapshots Trainers take of Pokémon, and I can never get enough of Bidoof!
Now—according to the research request we received, we must choose to focus our efforts on a Pokémon that has nerves of steel or a Pokémon that nests alongside water.
I know what you’re thinking: choosing between Bidoof and Bidoof isn’t easy. But, then again, the most important research rarely is!
You’re going with Bidoof, huh? I like your style, %PLAYERNAME%.
Bidoof isn’t just cute to look at—it’s more agile and active than it appears! Nothing can perturb it, making it an excellent member of your team.
I think we could all learn from that steadiness. Channel your inner Bidoof so you can steel your nerves, too!
You choose Bidoof, eh? I never doubted it for a second.
Bidoof often live in groups by the water where they make their nests. I recall that Bibarel, Bidoof’s Evolution, makes its nest by damming streams with bark and mud.
A river dammed by Bibarel will never overflow its banks, which is appreciated by people nearby. Fascinating, don’t you think?
Thank you, %PLAYERNAME%, for assisting me with this special assignment. I think we all learned that there’s more than meets the eye when it comes to Pokémon—especially Bidoof!
As a thank-you for your hard work, the team leaders and I prepared a gift for you to help show the world your love and knowledge of the indelible Bidoof. I hope you wear it with the pride it deserves.
Why don’t you put it on and enjoy a nice walk with your Bidoof? You never know what you might discover! Now, let’s GO!
Phase one, Razz Berry documentation: complete. Phase two, Pinap Berries.
Ah. %PLAYERNAME%. My apologies—I didn’t see you there. I’ve been preoccupied with completing my latest research report.
Early findings are promising, and I’m eager to discuss the results with Professor Willow.
But I must admit I’m having the slightest difficulty sourcing materials for the next step.
I’ve been so absorbed that I haven’t found a moment to shoo off the Team GO Rocket Grunts nearby. What’s more, they appear to have increased in number.
Nevertheless, these are my issues to resolve. What can I help you with today? It’s rare for you to stop by.
Professor Willow suggested you check on me? Well, I appreciate the thought, but it’s quite unnecessary.
Everything is under control here, so please, feel free to focus on your own studies. Now, where to source additional Berries...
Hm? I’m certain these Pinap Berries weren’t here earlier. And you’ve returned, %PLAYERNAME%? Then I suppose this was your doing.
You didn’t need to trouble yourself, but this does take one thing off my to-do list. Curious about how I’ll use them?
As you may know, my field of study includes Pokémon Evolution.
I’m currently investigating whether feeding a Pokémon various Berries immediately prior to it evolving has any influence on its physiology.
Speaking of which, the next step of this project is to see a Pokémon evolve. I’ll need to be on my way so I can locate one that’s ready.
Let’s continue our discussion another time, %PLAYERNAME%.
Did it occur to you to evolve your Pokémon because of what I said earlier, %PLAYERNAME%? Thank you.
You’ve saved me quite a bit of time. I now have just about everything I need to get back on track.
The end goal of my research? To learn more about Pokémon, of course. There’s no end to that endeavor, as Professor Willow might say.
On a personal level, I’d be satisfied if my research led to more insight on Lapras.
Lapras are able to understand human speech and are very intelligent. Their intellect and good nature are why I have one as my partner Pokémon.
Yet to the best of our knowledge, they do not evolve. I’d like to understand why.
I’ve been working on hypotheses as to why some Pokémon are able to evolve while others are not, but that is a far longer-term project.
Perhaps I speak from a place of bias, but I think you’d do well to have a Lapras accompany you on your travels too, %PLAYERNAME%.
I hope you and Lapras make all manner of discoveries together, %PLAYERNAME%—just like the discoveries you’ve helped me make today.
Thanks to your timely assistance, I can share my report far earlier than I initially anticipated.
You’ve shown me today why Professor Willow always calls you his hero.
You’re an observant friend and Trainer who has a knack for sensing when others are in need, even if they don’t see it themselves.
I suppose that makes you my hero too, %PLAYERNAME%.
Hello there, %PLAYERNAME%! Look around—have you ever seen so many Bulbasaur?
Personally, I’ve only witnessed a gathering like this once before. It was some time ago, and there were so many Trainers out and about catching all the little Seed Pokémon they could find.
In fact, seeing all these Bulbasaur has me feeling quite nostalgic!
It also reminded me of an important scientific tenet: there’s always more to learn! And I never tire of researching Pokémon, no matter the species.
In that spirit, what do you say we do some research on Bulbasaur, Trainer?
Welcome back, Trainer. That’s a downright adorable Bulbasaur you’ve caught!
Did you know that Bulbasaur uses the nutrients that are stored in the seed on its back to grow?
I’d love to have a built-in snack backpack. It would keep my stomach quiet in the field, that’s for sure! Haha!
As you may know, Bulbasaur’s Evolution—Ivysaur—gains strength when it’s exposed to sunlight.
That sunlight also makes the bud on its back grow larger. It would be lovely to witness that phenomenon myself, for old time’s sake.
While you go off and evolve your Bulbasaur, I’ll continue following this pack of Bulbasaur I’ve been observing. They appear to be on the move!
Goodness me, look at the size of that Ivysaur! Well done, %PLAYERNAME%.
If memory serves, the bud on Ivysaur’s back produces a sweet aroma when it starts to swell, indicating the flower’s about to bloom.
Have you gotten a whiff of that scent yet? If you do, your Ivysaur may be getting ready to evolve!
Now, remember that pack of Bulbasaur I was following? A handful of Ivysaur have recently emerged from a nearby forest to join them.
They all seem to be heading in the same direction... But what’s their destination, I wonder? Let’s go see if we can’t dig up some answers, hm?
Welcome back %PLAYERNAME%. Hold on—is that a Venusaur with you?! It must be my lucky day.
You see, the Bulbasaur and Ivysaur I was following led me to a grove where a Venusaur was resting. There was an unusual scent in the air that seemed to calm the Pokémon that had gathered.
I’ve read that Venusaur sometimes produces a scent that attracts other Pokémon, so I surmised that’s what was occurring.
In fact, the way the Bulbasaur and Ivysaur gathered around Venusaur reminded me of how Lure Modules work to attract Pokémon via scent.
Now, let’s talk Venusaur. Did you know it can Mega Evolve?
Take this Venusaur Mega Energy and try Mega Evolving your new friend. You’ll learn more by experiencing Mega Venusaur’s power for yourself!
There are so many things we can learn from Pokémon, and researching them can lead us to even more exciting discoveries. I hope you enjoyed yourself during today’s scientific excursion!
%PLAYERNAME%, you’ve been such a help in conducting Field Research and Special Research!
I have a feeling that there’s so much more about this world that we’ve yet to discover, and I’m glad I can count on you to see it through.
I’ve been doing some experiments of my own, and I suspect that I’m onto a further exciting discovery about another Mythical Pokémon that’s rarely seen.
Would you mind completing these tasks while I conclude my studies?
Please {0}, {1}, and {2}.
Wow, you and your Pokémon have some amazing power! But according to my most recent data, it seems that the Mythical Pokémon I’m tracking only appears in times of peace.
Also, from what I’ve gathered, it seems fond of forests and lush greens. Would you mind exploring this further, %PLAYERNAME%?
Let's {0}, {1}, and {2}.
Excellent work, %PLAYERNAME%! I feel we’re getting closer to this Mythical Pokémon. I wonder if we can find some more friends for it by hatching some Eggs.
Ah, and maybe you could put that Sun Stone you’ve earned to good use as well?
Please {0}, {1}, and {2}.
Oh wow, is that an Eevee you’ve caught? Perfect timing!
Did you know that this Pokémon’s unstable genetic makeup enables it to take on one of several different Evolutions?
I’ll bet if you spend some time with it during the day, you’ll be able to evolve your Eevee into an Espeon—a Psychic-type Pokémon just like the Mythical Pokémon I’m researching!
Can you {0}, {1}, and {2}?
Oh wow, is that an Eevee you’ve caught? Perfect timing!
Wait... Have we...had this conversation already? I’m getting a funny feeling in the back of my mind—like we’ve been here before.
%PLAYERNAME%, would you spend some time with this Eevee during the night? I think you’ll be able to see an intriguing evolved form as a result.
I wonder if this funny feeling will recur...
Please {0}, {1}, and {2}.
%PLAYERNAME%, I have some exciting news! That funny feeling hasn’t returned, but I did some important reading and learned that the Mythical Pokémon we’re researching has the ability to travel across time!
Maybe that’s why all of this is occurring...or recurring... Maybe this Pokémon is nearby?!
I suggest that you collect samples over the course of the next week and experiment with some Evolution items to see whether that feeling occurs again.
While you’re at it, do you have any Pinap Berries? My research could benefit from more data on their use. Return with that, and you can have these exotic Silver Pinap Berries!
Please {0}, {1}, and {2}.
This data is so helpful. Thank you! I’ll use it to explore my theory.
While you were in the field, I made more headway in learning about this Mythical Pokémon, and it seems that its mere presence causes grass and trees to flourish.
I think if you catch more Grass-type Pokémon, this elusive time-traveling Pokémon will reveal itself!
Let's {0}, {1}, and {2}.
%PLAYERNAME%, what an amazing experience! The appearance of the Mythical Pokémon Celebi is thought to be a sign that a bright and shining future awaits us.
You’ve come a long way in your research, and I must say you’re inspiring me to discover even more Pokémon. Until next time, %PLAYERNAME%!
Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! I hope you and your fellow Trainers have been taking care of yourselves. Remember to take a break every now and then to do something you really enjoy! I like to go on short walks, myself.
In fact, I was out for a stroll with my Buddy Pokémon earlier when I heard a strange crackling sound.
Upon further inspection, I realized it was a large group of Charmander gathered in an open field! The source of the noise was the soft crackling of their tail flames.
Seeing so many Charmander at once was highly unusual, though this wasn’t the first time I’ve witnessed such a gathering...
Well, whatever the reason, this is the perfect chance to learn more about Charmander!
Would you mind giving me a hand by catching some, Trainer?
Wonderful work, Trainer.
While you were out in the field, I looked through some research focused on Charmander and its Evolutionary line and came away with some interesting information.
For starters, Charmander is also known as the Lizard Pokémon and seems to be fond of hot things. You can tell how a Charmander is feeling by looking at the flame burning at the tip of its tail. What a fascinating Pokémon!
Hmmm... Perhaps those Charmander I ran into while walking were gathered to enjoy the sun? We may be able to learn more by evolving one.
Charmander’s evolved form is Charmeleon—but be careful when evolving Charmander! Charmeleon is known for its fiery temper!
That’s a fine Charmeleon you’ve got with you, %PLAYERNAME%!
Known as the Flame Pokémon, Charmeleon is hotheaded by nature and is constantly seeking out worthy opponents for battle.
When it finally encounters a worthy foe, it becomes so excited that the flame at the tip of its tail flares up and turns a bluish-white color.
The easiest way to calm a Charmeleon down is by winning a battle. That sure sounds like a certain team leader I know!
Now, did you know Charmeleon can evolve? Not only that, but its evolved form, Charizard, is also known as the Flame Pokémon! Come back and see me once you’ve evolved your Charmeleon.
Congrats, Trainer! Your Charmeleon has now become the Flame Pokémon Charizard!
Charizard is a truly amazing Pokémon. Its wings can carry it close to an altitude of 4,600 feet, and its fiery breath packs such great heat that it can melt almost anything!
While all that raw power seems intimidating, Charizard never turns its flames on any opponent weaker than itself.
What a superb display of control! It’s amazing to see how this Pokémon chooses to take on only the mightiest of opponents!
They say the key to a successful partnership is a powerful bond, Trainer, so why not celebrate by spending a little time with your new Charizard?
I can see you’re really putting an effort into strengthening the bond between you and your Pokémon, %PLAYERNAME%. Did you know that that bond can become a source of power for certain Pokémon? That’s right—I’m talking about Mega Evolution!
Mega Evolution is the result of a strong connection between a Pokémon and its Trainer. Charizard is unique not only because it can Mega Evolve but also because it has two different Mega-Evolved forms!
Its two Mega Evolutions, Mega Charizard X and Mega Charizard Y, each come with their own strengths.
It’s said that the overwhelming power dwelling within Mega Charizard X is so intense that it turns its body black and causes blue flames to spill from its mouth.
Other research suggests that Mega Charizard Y uses its bond with its Trainer as the source of its power, resulting in speed and maneuverability greater than that of a fighter jet’s.
Simply amazing! I can’t wait to see how Trainers use these Mega Evolutions in their Gym battle strategies!
Thanks again for your help, %PLAYERNAME%. I’ll be in touch as soon as I have more exciting research to share!
Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! Watch your step, there are—ow—broken rocks all over today.
I’ve been too occupied sweeping them up to find the cause, so I’m hoping you can help me figure out where they’ve come from. As with most odd occurrences, I suspect a Pokémon may be behind this.
Speaking of odd occurrences, I saw a shooting star last night! There’ve been more and more of them lately—always beautiful sights. Maybe some of these rocks are bits of meteor!
Anyway, I won’t keep you, %PLAYERNAME%. Go see what Pokémon are out today, and think about which ones might be inclined to shatter rocks.
Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! Judging by the Pokémon you’ve caught, I’m guessing you think Chespin’s the cause of the broken rocks.
You know what they say: “If the shell fits!” You know, when Chespin flex the quills on their heads, the points become so hard and sharp that they can pierce rock.
Pretty impressive, considering that the quills are usually soft.
And speaking of the wooden shell on its head—that thing’s so thick that even a direct hit from a truck wouldn’t faze Chespin!
Luckily for us, they’re good-natured Pokémon...even if they might have been having some fun with the local boulders. Help Chespin evolve and I’ll tell you more, %PLAYERNAME%!
Well done! That’s a strong-looking Quilladin, %PLAYERNAME%!
See how the shape of its shell has changed? It relies on that sturdy shell to deflect predators’ attacks, and then counterattacks with sharp quills.
Even so, they are very kind and won’t start fights.
It’s a quality that I imagine makes them ideal first partner Pokémon for Trainers starting out in the Kalos region—where Chespin, Quilladin, and Chesnaught were first discovered!
Speaking of Chesnaught, how about you help Quilladin evolve so we can observe one ourselves?
Now that is one fine-looking Chesnaught, %PLAYERNAME%! Great job!
Those quills on its back are bigger than ever, and when it takes a defensive posture with its fists guarding its face, it could withstand a bomb blast.
But just like Quilladin, this strapping Pokémon has a heart of gold. It will even shield its allies from danger with its own body.
Now that’s what I call a reliable partner!
And I know you’ll look after Chesnaught in turn. That’s just the kind of Trainer you are, %PLAYERNAME%.
Thanks for spending another exciting day researching Pokémon with me! I’ll be in touch soon!
Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! I just developed this new type of Incense—Daily Adventure Incense.
One Daily Adventure Incense lasts for 15 minutes and stays active only while you’re moving. Most importantly, though, this Incense can attract almost any Pokémon you’ve encountered before—even Legendary Pokémon!
I’ll give you one Daily Adventure Incense each day, so don’t be afraid to go out on some adventures! In fact, why not start one now? Try to catch as many Pokémon as you can!
Hello there, %PLAYERNAME%! We’ve come to the end of the year once again...
And it looks like some familiar Pokémon from earlier this year are reappearing, too!
Do you think they’re here to celebrate the year’s end with us?
I hope you’ll take a moment to reflect on all the ways you’ve grown and the adventures we had these last 12 months.
We achieved the impossible, created legends, and discovered so much about ourselves! Which moment are you most proud of?
Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%. Wow, just look at all the Pokémon you’ve caught! Up for another challenge?
Will you evolve a few of them for me? I’d say you’ve evolved plenty yourself, as a Trainer, this year. Especially after all that time with Hoopa.
What mischief it made this year—remember when it summoned all those Legendary Pokémon?
The bond between Trainer and Pokémon can change so much more than just a Pokémon’s appearance.
Just something to think about as you evolve your Pokémon today!
With a new year just around the corner, I can’t help but look back. What can we learn from the histories of places, Pokémon, and our fellow Trainers?
That reminds me—have you heard about the strange door I found recently? I have a feeling we’re in for quite an adventure!
I wonder what mysteries hide behind that door. What can this relic tell us about the past—and our shared future...?
Sorry, where were we? Ah, yes! Be sure to catch lots of Pokémon, study how they evolve, and maybe work on improving your Poké Ball throws, too. Let’s end the year awash in new knowledge!
You’ve made it to the end, %PLAYERNAME%! Here’s a reward for all your hard work. Consider it a token of my gratitude as well, for all you’ve done for me this year.
I look forward to our adventures together next year! Are you ready? Then let’s GO!
Hello, %PLAYERNAME%! Great to see you! I always feel a little nostalgic at the end of the year.
So I thought we could look back on everything we’ve done over the last twelve months.
For starters, you’ve been putting that Daily Adventure Incense to great use... You’ve encountered Zorua and been caught up in Ditto's shenanigans...
And that’s just the beginning! Doesn’t remembering your accomplishments get you energized for more?
It does for me, and maybe Pokémon are feeling energized by the season too—look how many are out there today!
I wonder if Pokémon perceive time like we do? Hmm... This could be a good topic for next year’s World Pokémon Ecological Society conference.
As for you, you should go for a stroll and think about all the amazing things you’ve done, %PLAYERNAME%!
You’ve brought a jolly bunch of Pokémon with you, %PLAYERNAME%!
Seeing all of them gets me thinking—remember how lucky we were to meet so many Pokémon first discovered in the Alola region?
We even encountered all of the island guardians! I’d never seen them in person before—had you?
It just goes to show that the more time we spend exploring the world, the more exciting sights we’ll see.
What’s that? “Even if that sight’s on the other side of an Ultra Wormhole?”
Ha ha! Very true, even if the experience was a little stressful. But I think it was worth it in the end, especially since we made a new friend—Rhi!
Speaking of which, why don’t you pay Rhi a visit? In the meantime, please let me take a closer look at some of those Pokémon you’ve caught.
Seasonal greetings, %PLAYERNAME%.  Is this appropriate to say? I have only learned of “seasons” after coming to this world.
You have been busy today. What has occupied your attention?
Reminiscing with Professor Willow? I am told that is a fitting activity for this time of the...day?
No–year. I apologize. Tracking time by the sun’s passage is new to me, although I do find it fascinating.
My thoughts? Hm.
As a member of the GO Ultra Recon Squad, I’ve journeyed through countless dimensions to learn more about the nature of Ultra Beasts and Ultra Wormholes.
I can confidently say that a world as vibrant and radiant as yours is quite rare.
As rare as making a friend as kind as you, %PLAYERNAME%. Your aid has been invaluable, both in acclimating me to this world and in containing the Ultra Beasts.
Our time together has been well-spent, from my perspective. If you are amenable, I would enjoy continuing our collaboration. Are you free right now?
I would like to observe as you catch some Pokémon. Your accuracy is remarkable, and I suspect I could learn something watching you.
Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%!
That’s another day of research done. Thank you for choosing to spend it with me—and with Pokémon!
This year has had its challenges, as they all do. But no matter what obstacles we face, I know I can rely on you to help overcome them...and that thought always brightens my day.
I hope that the time you’ve spent with me and with Pokémon has also been a source of joy, because you yourself bring joy to so many.
In fact, if I could make a wish right now, it’d be for our next year to be just as amazing as this one. And with you around, hey—I’m sure it will be. See you again soon, %PLAYERNAME%!
Hello there, %PLAYERNAME%! It’s so great to see you. Can you believe this year is already coming to a close?
It’s almost as if Pokémon in the wild can feel it, too. A few seem to be appearing in greater numbers than usual!
Strangely enough, the Pokémon appearing more frequently at the moment seem to be the same as those that did so previously throughout this year.
Seeing all these Abra, Rhyhorn, and Piplup in the wild is making me a bit nostalgic. We’ve had quite a year, haven’t we?
As you venture out to catch these Pokémon, I think it might be nice to reminisce on some of the highlights from this year and how much you’ve grown as a Pokémon Trainer along the way.
Who knows—you might even surprise yourself!
Great job catching all those Abra, Rhyhorn, and Piplup, Trainer.
As you were doing that, I was busy thinking about all we’ve accomplished together this year.
We discovered the secrets of trade Evolution and met a vast variety of Pokémon originally discovered in the Unova region.
We even encountered Legendary Pokémon like Tornadus, Thundurus, Reshiram, Zekrom, Landorus, and Kyurem!
Then there were the Pokémon originally discovered in the Galar region. I was particularly excited to see Galarian Ponyta, Galarian Rapidash, and Sirfetch’d!
Oh! And who could forget the mysterious appearance of Mega-Evolved Pokémon?
Hard to believe we fit all that into one year, eh, %PLAYERNAME%?
Anyway, I’ve rambled on long enough. It’s time for you to get back out there and catch some more Pokémon!
Ah—Weedle, Gastly, and Seedot. The stars of some memorable days this past year! I still get a bit jumpy at the sight of acorns. Haha!
Gastly gave us a bit of a fright as well. Remember?
OOOooooOOOoooo... BOO! Haha, sorry—I couldn’t help it.
You know, Gastly isn’t the only gaseous thing we saw in abundance this year.
That’s right—I’m talking about Team GO Rocket taking to the sky in balloons! An almost cartoonish mode of transportation, and yet surprisingly effective.
You know, if the members of Team GO Rocket weren’t so devoted to villainy, their assets and energy would likely make them great allies.
I hope that world comes to be someday.
Ah, pardon my wistfulness. I tend to get more and more pensive as the day wears on. Does that happen to you as well?
Perhaps you can ponder that while you go out and catch more Pokémon, %PLAYERNAME%!
It’s certainly been an interesting year, hasn’t it, %PLAYERNAME%? I can’t remember another one like it, and I’ve seen a few!
But despite all the ways it’s challenged us, I can’t help but think that it’ll make future experiences feel even more precious and special.
After all, no matter what happens, we’re all on this Pokémon journey together—every Trainer, regardless of where they are in the world.
That’s truly something special.
So when the going gets tough, remember that you’re not in this alone. And while bad days are inevitable, I like to think they make the good ones that much sweeter.
I hope today has been one of the good ones for you!
The world is ever changing, %PLAYERNAME%. What doesn’t change, however, is the fact that we have each other and our Pokémon.
And as the mysterious world of Pokémon continues to grow, so do we—as Trainers, as a community, and as people.
So here’s to a year for the books—and many more exciting ones to come!
It appears their aggression is primarily fueled by necessity...
Ah! Greetings again, Pokémon Trainer. You have found me mid-observation. An astounding amount of these Pokémon are present today—Deino, is it?
Bereft of sight, their first instinct is to bite. I have experienced this firsthand—but do not fret. The pain was minimal.
This world is replete with unique Pokémon. Though I wish to study them all, today’s focus will be on Deino alone.
May I borrow some moments from you, Pokémon Trainer? I would welcome your expertise in this endeavor.
Thank you for your assistance, Pokémon Trainer.
Deino tackle and bite at their surroundings. Even in darkness, they find novel ways to navigate the world...
......
Ahem. Do you think the Deino seek anything in particular? Sustenance, perhaps?
I see. It is normal in your world to feed Berries to Pokémon when attempting to catch them. Hmm... Deino may not be able to see, but I wonder how well they can smell and taste.
I wish to investigate the acuity of these senses by seeing how Deino respond to Berries. Will you assist me, Pokémon Trainer?
How dee, Pokémon Trainer. I have observed you sending Gifts to your friends affixed with charming decorations. Stuckums, is it? No? Ah—stickers. What is the function of these adornments?
I see... So they are primarily decorative, but can also communicate certain sentiments. There seems to be much comradery among the Pokémon Trainers in this world.
Deino may bite and tackle each other, but perhaps what appears aggressive and unfriendly is simply an interaction we do not understand. Putting yourself in the mind of a Pokémon can illuminate new perspectives, do you not think?
Hm? Your Professor Willow would also share his observations of the Pokémon you encountered? I hope you find my musings equally helpful.
If I may muse further: I am eager to observe Deino’s Evolution. Its physical changes may inform its behavior.
Astounding. You have shown me yet another wonder of this world, Pokémon Trainer.
I did not anticipate Deino would gain an additional head when it evolved to Zweilous—though I cannot discern if either head can see.
The two heads appear quite quarrelsome—particularly regarding food. Ah—be calm! There are Berries for all mouths!
Zweilous could learn much from the friendship you and I share. Perhaps it will do so as you travel together.
I have learned recently that Zweilous can evolve into a Pokémon called Hydreigon. Will it gain yet more heads? Will it trade quarrels for kindness?
Thank you for accompanying me in my investigation today, Pokémon Trainer.
I presumed the mysteries of the Ultra Wormholes and Ultra Beasts would be my primary focus here—but the Pokémon of your world hold many mysteries of their own.
Hey, %PLAYERNAME%, great timing! Fancy doing a little investigation?
All these Ultra Wormholes we’ve encountered lately have got me thinking. Ultra Space is fascinating, sure, but there are places closer to home that still beg to be explored—like the fabled island of Dragonite!
Have you heard the tale?
Once, a Dragonite saved a shipwrecked man, taking him to a remote island—a paradise occupied solely by Dragonite. Doesn’t that sound like something, %PLAYERNAME%?
Imagine the unique ecosystem that island would have! It’d be a veritable treasure trove for scientific inquiry.
Questions are already rattling around in my head: what do Dragonite use their horns for? How quickly can they move in water? What kind of Berries do they—
Whoops. I’m getting ahead of myself. First, we need to do some baseline research on the Pokémon in question.
We might even find some clues about this Dragonite paradise! 
Let’s start by observing Dratini, which can evolve into Dragonair and then Dragonite, %PLAYERNAME%!
Whoa! Look at how many Dratini you’ve caught, %PLAYERNAME%!
Did you know that in the past, Dratini was so rarely glimpsed that some called it the “Mirage Pokémon”?
And yet here you are with a whole host of them. They seem real enough to me!
You know, I read a report recently that a small colony of Dratini was found living underwater.
That would suggest that Dratini and its Evolutions like to live in groups.
And if that’s true...then the island of Dragonite could be real after all! First, though, we should learn more about Dratini’s Evolution, Dragonair.
Think you can find one, %PLAYERNAME%?
What a majestic Dragonair, %PLAYERNAME%!
Dragonair’s mystical appearance always leaves me in awe. In fact, this Pokémon is known for its gentle aura.
Some even call it divine! And for good reason—see the crystalline globes on its head and tail? Dragonair can use them to freely control the weather.
I bet that’d come in useful if you had, say, an island full of Dragonite that you wanted to keep hidden. Or if you were constantly forgetting your research notes outside on rainy days...
But that’s a me problem. Next, let’s help Dragonair evolve into the star of today’s studies—Dragonite!
Fantastic, %PLAYERNAME%!
Just like Dratini and Dragonair, Dragonite is an extremely rarely seen Pokémon. How lucky we are that we can study one today!
Dragonite is known as “the sea incarnate.” Incur the wrath of this normally calm Pokémon at your peril, because it will smash everything to smithereens before it’s satisfied.
Luckily for us, it’s typically a kindhearted Pokémon. If it spots a drowning person or Pokémon, Dragonite simply must help them—like that shipwrecked man I mentioned earlier today.
Why don’t we set sail and get looking for that island? Dragonite’ll surely bail us out if things go sideways!
I’m joking, I’m joking. Thanks for humoring me today, %PLAYERNAME%.
Even without weighing anchor, we learned more about Pokémon and found new ways to look at facts we already knew. I’d say that’s time well spent.
Though to be fair, I’d say that about any time we spend together. Heh. I’ll be in touch again soon, %PLAYERNAME%!
Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! Have you noticed an increase in Ghost-type Pokémon appearing lately? Because I sure have.
I was conducting some research in my lab recently when I felt a chill run up my spine—almost like something was watching me from the shadows.
I whirled around to face my uninvited guest and saw a Pokémon floating eerily in the corner! Apparently startled by my gaze, it flew through the wall and escaped into the great outdoors. I haven’t seen it since.
Based on my brief glimpse of it and its quick escape, I believe my visitor was Duskull, the Requiem Pokémon. It’s known to silently sneak up on its prey by making itself invisible. It also has the ability to slip straight through thick walls.
Naturally, my goal now is to learn more about Duskull. Can you lend me a hand? Hopefully we can come to understand why it was sneaking around my lab!
Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! Great work researching Duskull. While you were out, I actually had another eerie encounter in my lab.
I saw Duskull slipping through a wall to scare me again, so I shouted, “BOO!” before it could and turned the tables. It fled back through the wall—but then it reappeared and looked at me expectantly.
Thus began an impromptu game of peek-a-boo! It made me realize that Duskull may not get many chances to play with others because people are so quick to startle at its appearance. Makes you a bit sad, doesn’t it?
I wonder what else we can learn about Duskull. I know: Why don’t you try evolving your Duskull into Dusclops? Also known as the Beckon Pokémon, Dusclops apparently sucks everything in as if it were a black hole—so be careful of its mouth!
Wait, %PLAYERNAME%, you did WHAT? I was so sure I told you NOT to feed a Berry to Dusclops... But maybe I said the opposite by mistake? Yeah, my bad on that one.
But it just ate the Berry normally, huh? No danger of you getting sucked in as well? Fascinating... O-oh, and, er, quite relieving! Yes, glad to see you back in one piece.
Now, let’s learn more about Dusclops’s Evolution, Dusknoir. Known as the Gripper Pokémon, it’s said to steal people and Pokémon away at the behest of transmissions from the spirit world.
No one knows whether Dusknoir has a will of its own. Sounds like a Pokémon ripe for researching! Could you evolve your Dusclops for me so we can learn more?
Hey there, Trai— AAAH! G-G-G-GHOST! Behind you! It’s— Wait. Is that Dusknoir? Hah, sorry about that. It’s my first time seeing one!
No matter how spooky they may seem, we have to remember that Ghost-type Pokémon are Pokémon all the same. They’re looking for friends just like the rest of us!
Thanks for your help today, %PLAYERNAME%. I hope to see you and your Dusknoir again soon!
Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%!
Not sure if you’ve noticed, but there seems to be a huge influx of Eevee, the Evolution Pokémon!
Some theorize that the key to the mysteries of Pokémon Evolution lies within Eevee’s genetics.
I can understand that hypothesis—after all, Eevee can evolve into EIGHT Pokémon!
I sure wish I were as adaptable as Eevee!
I don’t even have eight different outfits. I basically wear this lab coat all the time—even to formal events!
Anyway, perhaps by researching Eevee, we’ll unravel even more mysteries of Pokémon Evolution!
I can’t wait to get started! Let’s GO learn about Eevee!
Great work with your research on Eevee, %PLAYERNAME%!
According to my findings, Eevee’s irregular DNA gives it the ability to evolve into many different Pokémon.
For example, it has three Evolutions originally discovered in the Kanto region: the Water-type Vaporeon, the Electric-type Jolteon, and the Fire-type Flareon.
Isn’t it fascinating that Eevee can evolve into Pokémon of such different types?
As you work on your Eevee research, perhaps you might learn more about these Pokémon. Good luck!
Great work, %PLAYERNAME%! I see you’ve gotten a Vaporeon, a Jolteon, and a Flareon!
These incredible creatures are capable of some impressive feats.
Did you know that Vaporeon can melt away into water?
Or that Jolteon can blast out 10,000-volt lightning bolts?
And that Flareon breathes fire that is over 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit?
Isn’t it amazing that all three of these Pokémon evolve from Eevee?
Perhaps there’s something besides genetics that gives Eevee so much potential.
Let’s do some more research to learn more about Eevee. At certain times of the day, this Pokémon can evolve into Pokémon originally discovered in the Johto region: the Psychic-type Espeon and the Dark-type Umbreon.
If you keep up your research, you might find them as well!
Great work, %PLAYERNAME%! Looks like you’ve gotten yourself an Espeon and an Umbreon!
The Psychic-type Espeon can use the fine hair on its body to sense air currents and predict its enemies’ next move. It usually evolves from Eevee during the daytime.
As for the Dark-type Umbreon, it evolves from Eevee during the nighttime. It’s said that Umbreon’s rings glow yellow under the full moon.
Who would’ve thought that something like the time of day could affect Pokémon Evolution!
It’s wonderful to delve even deeper into the mysteries of Pokémon.
Let’s keep it up by researching Eevee’s Evolutions that were originally discovered in the Sinnoh region.
The Grass-type Leafeon and Ice-type Glaceon seem to have evolved in order to adapt to their environment.
Why don’t you research these Pokémon next?
%PLAYERNAME%, welcome back!
I see you’ve managed to get a Leafeon and a Glaceon! Congratulations!
The vastly different environments in the Sinnoh region appear to have caused the adaptable Eevee to evolve into a Grass-type Pokémon and an Ice-type Pokémon. It’s inspiring to see how resilient this little Pokémon can be!
We might not uncover all the secrets of Pokémon Evolution today, but I think we can learn a lot about ourselves through Pokémon.
Researching Eevee today has taught me there are so many paths in life to choose from.
I hope that Eevee can inspire you to find the one that suits you best.
But enough of this professor’s ramblings. Eevee is known to have just one more Evolution—the Fairy-type Sylveon, which was originally discovered in the Kalos region.
This Pokémon has ribbonlike feelers that it uses to calm others. Sylveon evolves from Eevee when it reaches a certain level of friendship and trust with its beloved Trainer. Knowing that almost brings a tear to my eye!
I hope you have the good fortune of crossing paths with a wonderful Pokémon like Sylveon sometime soon.
Until then, let’s GO!
Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! I’m really glad to see you.
I’ve been dealing with some strange power outages in my mobile lab and wanted to investigate what could be causing them.
It didn’t take me long to find the cause. Seems as though a group of Electabuzz decided that the mobile lab’s electricity would make an excellent snack.
Electabuzz seem to be appearing in higher numbers, which could lead to more outages.
Do you think you could catch some of these Pokémon?
The research would be valuable, and I’d be grateful to have my power restored!
Welcome back, Trainer.
Thanks for the assistance—I really appreciate it! While you were out catching Electabuzz, I did some research on this Pokémon’s Evolutionary line.
Did you know that Electabuzz evolves from Elekid?
A weak electric current flows between Elekid’s horns. Be careful, Trainer! Sticking a hand between its horns will shock you!
Hmm... I wonder whether Spark has tried that with his Buddy Pokémon...
Anyway, let’s keep researching these Electabuzz and make sure they aren’t snacking on any electricity meant for other uses!
Great work, %PLAYERNAME%. I think we have enough data on Electabuzz.
Also known as the Electric Pokémon, it loves to feed on strong electricity. That explains why so many Electabuzz were attracted to my mobile lab.
Electricity runs across the surface of Electabuzz’s body. In darkness, its entire body glows a whitish blue.
Simply amazing! Let’s continue our research. Go ahead and use a Sinnoh Stone to evolve Electabuzz into Electivire!
I can’t wait to see what electrifying facts we’ll learn about that Evolution!
I just don’t ever know whether they find my jokes funny... Should I take a comedy class?
OH! I didn’t see you there, %PLAYERNAME%. I see you’ve evolved your Electabuzz into Electivire like I asked. Thank you!
According to the Pokédex, as Electivire’s electric charge amplifies, blue sparks begin to crackle between its horns.
When in battle, Electivire pushes the tips of its two tails against its foe, then lets loose with over 20,000 volts of power. I guess you could say its opponent is in for a shock!
Be careful with this Pokémon when battling with it—that’s a lot of power you’re dealing with!
With the lights back on in the mobile lab, I’m going to head back and wrap up some other projects.
Thank you again for all your help, and until next time, let’s GO!
*yawn*
Oh, hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! Sorry you caught me mid-yawn. I was up late reading the newest Pokémon Researcher’s Weekly.
There was a fascinating article about Fennekin, and coincidentally, they’re all over the place today!
Did you know Fennekin are filled with energy after eating twigs? If that worked for me, I would’ve made myself a plate of scrumptious sticks to get through my reading last night.
But why read about Fennekin when we can make our own observations!
What kind of twigs do Fennekin prefer? Do you think each Fennekin has a unique preference?
Think on those questions while you observe the Fennekin in the area, %PLAYERNAME%!
Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%.
Have you gathered any promising information? I see you’ve at least gathered some promising Fennekin!
They sure are cute and fluffy, but I’d be careful about getting too close. Their roomy ears vent blistering hot air.
Hmm... These fine Fennekin don’t look like they have any twigs on them.
Maybe we’ll get a better view of some sprigs with Fennekin’s Evolution, Braixen. Instead of snacking on twigs, they stick them in their tails.
If you’re curious why, bring one by and I’ll tell you all about it!
What a beautiful Braixen, %PLAYERNAME%!
I’ll tell you about that twig, as promised.
When the twig is plucked from its tail, friction sets it alight. It uses the flame to send signals to its allies.
What do you suppose Braixen communicate about? Maybe where to find the most energizing stick snacks?
These Pokémon’s cleverness with tools doesn’t stop there. Braixen’s Evolution, Delphox, can use branches to see into the future.
I’m no Delphox, but I sure see a Delphox in your future!
Looks like my prediction came true, %PLAYERNAME%! That Delphox of yours is downright delightful!
Delphox gaze into the flame at the tip of their branches to achieve a focused state, allowing them to see into the future.
And when they use their psychic power, they can generate a fiery vortex, incinerating foes swept into this whirl of flame.
It’s a wonder their branches don’t catch fire! Could Delphox be using their psychic powers to protect their branches?
If you continue observing your Delphox, perhaps you’ll find the answer.
But until then, thanks for spending another day researching with me. See you later, %PLAYERNAME%!
Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%. How’s your day?
Personally, mine is going swimmingly. Or perhaps…flappingly? You see, an enormous flock of Fletchling has gathered nearby.
I heard some Pokémon chirping up a storm, so I went to investigate and found Fletchling as far as the eye can see!
Fletchling is known as the Tiny Robin Pokémon, and it’s typically quite amiable and easy to train. Send it into battle, though, and you’ll quickly see its more ferocious side!
A fascinating little Pokémon. But as glad as I am to see it here, it’s quite odd for so many to gather in one place.
Would you mind conducting some research so we can better understand what’s going on?
Great work, Trainer. Looks like you’ve got your very own Fletchling to join you on your journey!
Did you know that Fletchling’s body is always warm? In fact, Trainers who live in cold areas apparently sleep with this Pokémon in their beds. How about that?
I’m always fascinated to learn about how Pokémon and their Trainers work and live together. And it never hurts to know how to cope on cold nights, eh?
Anyway, Fletchling evolves into the Fire- and Flying-type Pokémon Fletchinder.
Known as the Ember Pokémon, Fletchinder is exceedingly territorial and aggressive.
It’s also incredibly fast. Its speed from takeoff puts it easily among the fastest of all bird Pokémon.
When you’re ready, why don’t you try evolving your Fletchling into Fletchinder? I’d love to witness that famous speed firsthand!
That’s a mighty fine Fletchinder you have there, %PLAYERNAME%. Congratulations!
Naturally, I’ve been busy as well. In fact, I have some information you may find useful as you train Fletchinder.
You see, Fletchinder is known to expel embers from its beak to set grass on fire. Then, it pounces on the bewildered prey that flee the flames.
Pretty intense, huh? Best not to wing it during training, if you catch my draft—er, drift.
Try not to let any fires Fletchinder starts get out of hand, too. We’re all responsible for caring for our environment, after all!
With that said, there are still a few more tasks I’d like you to complete in aid of our research.
Chief among those is to obtain a Talonflame, the evolution of Fletchinder. They’re said to have simply magnificent wings! Do you think you could evolve your Fletchinder, Trainer?
Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%—and hello, Talonflame!
I know I’ve put you through your paces today, but it’s all paid off in the end! You’re now the proud Trainer of Talonflame, the Scorching Pokémon.
Talonflame is known to shower embers from the gaps between its feathers during the heat of battle. It then takes to the air, reaching speeds of up to 310 mph.
Remember how I mentioned Talonflame’s wings before? Fire can’t pass through them, so they were used to outfit firefighters way back when.
Amazing stuff! I’m always impressed by this brave bird. The two of you will no doubt accomplish great things—and at great speeds!
Thanks for your help today, Trainer. I hope you had as much fun as I did!
Now, let’s GO!
%PLAYERNAME%! It’s so great to see you! The strangest things have been happening lately.
You see, I begin each day with a Pinap Berry and coffee for breakfast, then head outside my lab to take in the crisp morning air before starting my research.
A couple days ago, however, I stepped outside and slipped on a sheet of ice right outside the entrance of my lab! Coffee—spilled. Pinap Berry—squished. Day—ruined.
At first, I thought the ice formed because it was an especially chilly day, but it was in fact nowhere near cold enough to create a sheet of ice that thick!
For my sake—and my breakfast’s—can you help me research Ice-type Pokémon to see whether we can discover anything? *sniffle* My poor breakfast...
Great work, %PLAYERNAME%! We’ve learned quite a bit about Ice-type Pokémon, and it looks as if you’ve caught a few interesting ones!
I feel like we’re getting closer to finding out the cause of my breakfast’s untimely demise. Oh! There’s something I forgot to mention.
That very evening—after an incredibly sad, breakfast-less day—I was trying to cheer myself up by dressing in my comfiest pajamas and drinking a cup of herbal tea before tucking into bed.
As I lay there, ready to count Mareep and fall asleep, I was suddenly awoken by some unnerving tapping outside my lab! It sounded like...tap-dancing?
I was simply too comfortable in bed—and too frightened—to get up and check. All I could do was lie there and hope the tapping would end soon.
I now believe source of that tapping was the same Pokémon that created the sheet of ice in front of my mobile lab.
Can you investigate some Pokémon related to making peculiar sounds? Let’s see whether we can get closer to solving this case before it goes cold.
... ... ... OH! %PLAYERNAME%, you scared me. I was a bit distracted thinking about the tap-dancing I heard last night, as well as the shadow I saw pass by my window.
Oh, I didn’t mention that last part? Yes, it was quite an unnerving experience! Anyway, let me take a look at all the research you’ve done.
Oh! OH! Oh my goodness! All right, I think I know the source of these strange occurrences now.
I believe the culprit is the Galarian form of the Barrier Pokémon—Mr. Mime!
Galarian Mr. Mime is known as the Dancing Pokémon. It likes to create a sheet of ice and tap-dance on it. What a strange Pokémon!
While Galarian Mr. Mime is the prime suspect, it’s still just a hunch. Can you go out and do a bit more research to confirm? Maybe you might even come across a Galarian Mr. Mime!
Phew! Great job catching that Galarian Mr. Mime, %PLAYERNAME%! I guess it’s not as frightening as I first thought.
Perhaps it’ll become even more approachable when it evolves?
I’ve read that Galarian Mr. Mime evolves into Mr. Rime, the Comedian Pokémon. Mr. Rime is apparently highly skilled at tap-dancing and waves its cane of ice in time with its graceful movements.
I wonder whether it could teach me some new moves. Haha! Anyway, how about you try evolving your Galarian Mr. Mime?
What a fascinating Pokémon Mr. Rime is! Thank you for evolving your Galarian Mr. Mime, %PLAYERNAME%.
I've heard stories of Mr. Rime’s amusing movements, and you know what? Color me amused. What a COOL discovery this was!
This has definitely been an unforgettable adventure, but I’m not sure I can say I’d do it again, given the chilling way it started. My poor breakfast...
Until next time, %PLAYERNAME%. Let’s GO!
%PLAYERNAME%! Excellent timing.
I just made a tremendously exciting discovery!
Earlier today, I was exploring a nearby cave to collect some samples when I noticed a peculiar warmth along one of the walls.
Suddenly, something jumped out and tried to bite me!
I quickly realized I had stumbled upon a nest of Gible, the Land Shark Pokémon. Gible is known to react to anything that moves, so sometimes it leaps out and chomps passersby.
I know it just wanted a nibble, but that’s a nibble too much in my book!
Anyway, it’s not every day you run into a gaggle of Gible. Do you think you could head out and do some research on their appearance here?
Welcome back, Trainer.
While you were out tracking down the Land Shark Pokémon, I took a closer look at the cave I was telling you about earlier.
I was reminded of an interesting tidbit about Gible. It nests inside small, horizontal holes in cave walls warmed by geothermal heat.
Gible seems to love warm places, and that cave certainly fits the bill.
We’ve learned a lot about this Dragon- and Ground-type Pokémon, but there’s always more to discover!
When you’re ready, how about you try evolving your Gible into Gabite?
Nice job evolving your Gible into Gabite, %PLAYERNAME%!
Gabite is known as the Cave Pokémon, and it loves sparkly things.
It emits ultrasonic waves from protrusions on either side of its head to probe pitch-dark caves.
What a useful ability! Maybe it could help me avoid bumping into lab equipment in the middle of the night...
We’ve seen Gible and Gabite, but there’s still one more Evolution we need to document. Come see me when you’ve evolved your Gabite, Trainer!
Ah! Fantastic work, %PLAYERNAME%. That’s an admirable Garchomp!
Known as the Mach Pokémon, its body is covered in fine scales that reduce drag, enabling it to fly at high speeds.
Those scales don’t just reduce wind resistance—their sharp edges also cause injury to any opponent that touches them. Pretty spiffy, eh?
I think you’ll find Garchomp to be a powerful companion on your adventures.
And I can’t wait to see how your relationship develops along the way!
Thanks for all your help today, Trainer. I hope you had a fin-tastic time!
Now, let’s GO!
%PLAYERNAME%! Thank goodness you made it.
I was ready for a fun-filled day of playing with Pokémon, but as you may have seen, the park has all sorts of unusual geological phenomena occurring!
We need to figure out what’s happening and set it right, so I'm asking for your help.
Now that you’re here, I need you to be part of my Elite Research team.
First things first—could you help survey the park and get some supplies?
Please complete the following research tasks.{0}{1}{2}
Yowzers! As you may have noticed, the park has all sorts of unusual geological phenomena going on today!
I’m not sure what could have caused it—they just appeared out of nowhere...and they seem to be getting bigger and bigger!
Whatever is causing it, the local park habitat here is quite disrupted by all the changes.
The local Pokémon have become confused… It looks like they’re acting more aggressive and territorial!
Let's see if we can help out by catching some Pokémon to make the situation a bit more stable.
Please catch some Fire-, Steel-, Water-, Grass-, Rock-, and Ice-type Pokémon!
Well, it looks like there were some pretty powerful Pokémon causing the ruckus. Thanks for taking care of them! I'm sure they'll make great friends.
However, I'm not sure that was sufficient—the strange habitats are just as active as before. The local park and all the Pokémon here seem worried. We need to get to the bottom of this!
I've been seeing some unusual Pokémon called Unown floating around the area...
This Pokémon is shaped like ancient writing…and I think they may be trying to tell us something! I think they want us to call on a powerful Pokémon—the Guardian of the Forest? I'll bet if we follow the Unown around the park, they'll lead us to this Pokémon!
Let's do the following research tasks.{0}{1}{2}
Amazing! Never thought I would see Celebi here.
I think Celebi's time travel abilities may be exactly what we need to fix the situation.
Celebi can go back in time and stop these distortions while they're still small!
It's a difficult task… We need to ensure Celebi has all the support it needs!
The Plusle and Minun in the park would be perfect to help us out.
These Pokémon are famous for loving teamwork and cheering on their partners with their pom-poms made of sparks!
If we collect a bunch, I think they'll be able to work together to get Celebi really pumped up!
Then Celebi can focus its power to return to the past and prevent this problem before it starts!
Quickly, %PLAYERNAME%, let's complete these research tasks!{0}{1}
That did it! It seems like the strange habitats are slowly returning to normal.
It appears that Celebi has safely returned from the past to stay with you. Looks like you two have formed a bond!
I'll bet by next weekend the park will have returned to its old self! Celebi is truly a wondrous Pokémon!
Thanks for all your help today! We couldn't have done it without you.
This weekend will be one to remember!
Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! I’m glad you’re here. Something odd is happening, and I need your help investigating it.
While I was on a walk last night with my Buddy Pokémon, Meltan, I noticed a strange light flickering in my mobile lab. It was so spooky! One might’ve called it...a ghastly sight!
Apparently, some Gastly were in my mobile lab hiding from the wind. It’s common for them to take shelter when massive gusts are blowing about so their gaseous bodies aren’t blown away.
However, the sheer number of Gastly seemed unusual. They’re still in the mobile lab, so could you help me look into this situation?
Thanks, %PLAYERNAME%! While you were helping with our research, I was assisting the Gastly in the mobile lab.
I had to be careful when I got near the Gastly. I didn’t want to be engulfed by their gaseous bodies!
Now that the Gastly are out of the mobile lab, I think it’s time for us to start looking into Gastly’s Evolution.
I’ve done some reading on the matter, and I think we’ll need to prepare for a dangerous Pokémon.
Excellent work, %PLAYERNAME%. Seems as though your Gastly has evolved into Haunter. I had a feeling I was being watched.
It’s said that Haunter lurks in walls to keep an eye on its foes, but in this case, I have a feeling it’s just being playful.
I’ve noticed the team leaders tripping and stumbling around the lab today. Seems as if Haunter is having a bit of fun with them, but I don’t think Blanche is amused.
Let’s go ahead and fix that problem by evolving Haunter.
Congrats, Trainer. Your Haunter has now become the Shadow Pokémon, Gengar! Are you ready for a spooky story? Let me get my flashlight.
If you ever see your shadow suddenly and startlingly overtake you, it might be a Gengar running past you, pretending to be your shadow!
Do you feel that chill in the air? That means a Gengar is near. OOOoooOOOooo...
BOO!
Hahaha, got you, %PLAYERNAME%! I crack myself up. Although...it looked for a second like there was a ghostly hand on your shoulder... Maybe it was just my imagination.
Anyway, I know an accomplished Trainer such as yourself has nothing to fear when it comes to training a Pokémon like Gengar. Being both Poison- and Ghost-type, it’s a fantastic Pokémon to have on your team.
Thanks to your help, I think we all learned something today! I’ll be in touch when I have another adventure for you!
OoOoOo... There’s a chill in the air... Can you feel it, %PLAYERNAME%?
Seems like I’ve been getting goosebumps every few minutes lately! Is it just drafty, or are all the Ghost-type Pokémon we’ve been seeing somehow involved?
Either way, I think we’re in for another adventure! Whatever happens, we’ll face it together.
Speaking of faces, I’ve noticed a lot of Yamask in the area lately.
I’ve been hoping to do some research on it and other Ghost-type Pokémon, so it seems like now’s the time.
Mind lending me a hand, Trainer?
Ah—a Yamask AND a Duskull!
I recently had an encounter with a Duskull that seemed creepy at first but ended up being quite heartwarming.
It was a lovely reminder not to judge a Pokémon by its...well, skull, I suppose!
Now, about that Yamask.
Known as the Spirit Pokémon, Yamask is said to wander through ruins by night carrying a mask that was once its human face.
A rather melancholy existence, if true, wouldn’t you say?
What must it feel like to carry around a mask of your former self? No offense to Yamask, but I hope I never have to find out firsthand.
Did you know that Yamask found in Galar are different than those found in Unova?
Perhaps you’ll come across one while you’re out conducting research.
I wonder just how these Yamask differ. Let’s go find out!
Wow, a Galarian Yamask!
Unlike Yamask first found in Unova, Galarian Yamask carries a slab rather than a mask.
It’s said that the slab bears cursed engravings and possesses Yamask itself. Talk about spooky!
Oh, and you’ve encountered a Banette, too! Did you know that Banette is said to be a doll that became a Pokémon through the power of its grudge toward the child that disowned it?
I wouldn’t want to be that kid, that’s for sure!
Between Galarian Yamask’s slab, Banette’s puppet body, and all the Pokémon in costumes walking around, it feels like the spooky factor’s turned way up at the moment!
Even so, I’d still like to learn more about Ghost-type Pokémon.
Come on, Trainer—let’s get back out there!
Looks like we’re coming up on the last stretch of our research here, Trainer. And hey, it looks like you found yourself an Alolan Marowak!
Did you know that the bones used by some Marowak belonged to their mothers?
In fact, Cubone—which evolves into Marowak—is even said to wear the skull of its mother.
When Cubone evolves into Alolan Marowak, its mother’s regrets protect it like a vengeful spirit.
Hmm. Between Alolan Marowak, Banette, and Yamask, we’ve witnessed the power of quite a few spirits, haven’t we?
Try as I might to explain why Ghost-type Pokémon seem spooky, sometimes I just come up blank. But that won’t stop me from continuing to try!
After all, I always feel like I learn a bit more about myself when I’m studying Pokémon. You know what I mean?
Anyway, I think we’re more than due some rest and treats after all that research. See you next time, %PLAYERNAME%!
%PLAYERNAME%. It is fortunate you’ve arrived.
I just observed a curious sight.
Floating over there were vaguely human visages, and carved slabs of...clay?
Yet despite the differences between these apparitions, they had a similar air.
As with many mysterious things in this world, I suspect Pokémon to be behind this.
Assuming I am correct, I wish to catch them. Then perhaps Professor Willow can share his insight.
Where’s that old getup of mine—oh! Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%!
I’ve been thinking of what to wear to Spark’s upcoming costume party. A Litwick hat? A Pikachu onesie? I can’t have Candela outshine me again this year.
Speaking of masquerades—is that a Yamask AND a Galarian Yamask? I can’t disguise my excitement!
You know, they say Yamask carry masks that used to be their faces when they were human. Sometimes they look at them and cry.
And Galarian Yamask are supposedly formed when ancient clay tablets are drawn to vengeful spirits.
Somber origins, but don’t they set your curiosity ablaze? I wonder how Yamask feel now that they’ve become Pokémon. What sort of thoughts are running through their minds?
In the “spirit” of inquiry, why don’t you see what other Ghost-type Pokémon you can find? You might even come across more Yamask!
Professor Willow is certainly knowledgeable. We were right to seek his wisdom.
To think that Yamask and Galarian Yamask have such origins... Incredible.
I must thank you for catching them. With every day we spend together, I learn something new.
The Pokémon we’ve seen of late have been...dark, in a manner of speaking.
But as the Professor said, they are simply another mystery we researchers can illuminate with our findings. Fear need not be a component of exploring the unknown.
%PLAYERNAME%, I shall continue observing these Yamask as I ponder today’s events.
Perhaps you could investigate other Ghost-type Pokémon in the meantime.
And to repay Professor Willow, I could see if I possess a GO Ultra Recon Squad uniform in his size...
Ah, %PLAYERNAME%! Welcome back. I’ve just about finished my Yamask, erm, mask, inspired by you and Rhi! What’ve the two of you been up to?
Whoa, you’ve caught even more Ghost-type Pokémon! It’s starting to look like a haunted house around here—or a haunted lab.
Ghost-type Pokémon always remind me how much remains in the world for us to uncover. Where do Drifloon drift off to? Do Duskull really spirit away bad children? What powers a Golett?
With enough time and perseverance, I’m sure we researchers will find the answers to these questions and more. Or maybe they’ll be answered by an up-and-at-’em Trainer like you! When it comes to learning, jump in headfirst, I always say!
Though...maybe I should amend that motto to exclude Ultra Wormholes. Haha.
Thanks for the extra motivation today, %PLAYERNAME%. I’ll see you again soon!
BOO! Haha, hey there, %PLAYERNAME%!
Hope I didn’t scare you too badly. I was just having a bit of fun during this spooky season.
Say, since you’re here, I was wondering whether you could help me. I’ve heard some reports of an unusual Pokémon appearing in a nearby forest.
Why aren’t I going into that dark forest to find this Pokémon myself? W-well, er, it’s certainly not because I’m scared!
Y-you see I would, but I’m busy here with some...uh...research! Yes!
Oh! I think I see Blanche over there near my lab. Maybe it’s time for some research into the Evolution of Ghost-type Pokémon!
Could you go on ahead and let me know what you find, %PLAYERNAME%? Thanks—and good luck!
Blanche, do you really think this Galarian Pokémon can evolve? Oh, glad to see you again, %PLAYERNAME%— AH!
What’s that sound?! Oh, it’s just a Yamask. Seems like it’s looking at its mask and crying.
Ah, so Yamask was the unusual Pokémon appearing in the forest? I see. Sorry, Trainer, but it looks like you’re going to have to venture back out there.
After comparing eyewitness reports with some texts I found about Ghost-type Pokémon, it turns out we aren’t looking for this particular kind of Yamask, which was originally discovered in the Unova region, but another one entirely!
The Yamask we’re looking for was first discovered in the Galar region and seems to be carrying a clay slab. The texts say that the slab absorbs that Yamask’s dark power.
Unfortunately, I can’t come along with you this time, either. Because, uh...it looks like Spark needs my help with some Strange Eggs! See ya later, and good luck!
Yup, still seems like mostly Poison- and Dark-type Pokémon are hatching from Strange Eggs. I sure am glad we got to confirm what we already— Oh!
Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! How are— EGAD! A Spiritomb! What a tricky Ghost-type Pokémon.
I’ve worked with Trainers to research Spiritomb in previous years. Maybe you’ve encountered a Spiritomb before!
There seem to be a few more Spiritomb around than in the past. That’s quite frightening, given that each Spiritomb is formed by 108 spirits bound to a keystone.
One might say that it’s BOUND to be a real spooky season! Haha, sorry, Spiritomb—too much?
Anyway, I hate to ask you again, Trainer, but third time’s the charm, right? I’m sure you’ll encounter the illusive and elusive Galarian Yamask this time!
I, uh, have to go help Candela prep for an upcoming Trainer Battle, but you go on ahead! Good luck, %PLAYERNAME%!
Poison-, Bug-, Ghost-, Dark-, and Fairy-type Pokémon—looks like you’re all set for a spooky Trainer Battle, Candela!
Oh, hi there, %PLAYERNAME%! And hello, Galarian Yamask! What a curious Pokémon this is. It gives off a totally different energy.
Blanche and I were looking into the Evolution of Ghost-type Pokémon earlier, and it appears that Galarian Yamask evolves into an entirely different Pokémon than its counterpart from Unova does!
All you need is to collect some Yamask Candies and get to evolving! I’m certain that its Evolution will be an exciting addition to your Pokédex!
Anyway, I’m so glad we got to go on this spooky adventure and discover Galarian Yamask together!
I hope you had a ghoulishly good time, and I hope you have an extra spoOoOoOoOoOoky day!
Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! Quite an eventful few months we’ve had, eh?
How are things with Hoopa? You two seem to get along great from what I can tell.
I suspect its trust in you must have deepened after you protected it from Team GO Rocket.
While you and Hoopa have been out adventuring together, my research into the mystery surrounding Hoopa has taken some strange turns.
I was up late poring over my notes recently when I heard a knock at the door of my mobile lab. I certainly wasn’t expecting anyone, but I figured it would be rude not to answer.
As I approached the door, I heard something scurrying away, and when I opened it, I found nothing but a curious bottle at my feet.
There was a note attached. I’ve managed to decipher only part of it, but here’s what I’ve got so far.
“Offer sweets and dust you’ve found So Hoopa’s form will be unbound
Hoopa Unbound is said to be tremendously powerful—but I think you can handle it, Trainer.
It’s been a long adventure with Hoopa, but I think we’ve finally reached the end.
It’s almost bittersweet, don’t you think? But fret not—I’m sure more discoveries await!
Let’s keep adventuring through this world full of mysteries—you, me, and Hoopa!
Of course, this is all just a theory.
We’ll have to test it before reaching any proper conclusions!
Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%!
I just saw the most wonderful thing: hundreds of Hoppip are filling the sky! You’d think the clouds were pink with how many there are out there right now.
I believe this is the perfect opportunity for us to learn more about Hoppip, the Cottonweed Pokémon, don’t you agree?
It’s said that when Hoppip gather in fields and mountains, spring is on the way.
Does it feel like spring yet, with all these Hoppip floating about? Let’s see about catching a few to find out more about them.
Wow, look at all those Hoppip! Hoppip are so light that they grip the ground with their feet to keep from being blown away. They also like to huddle up and link their leaves to stay grounded as a group.
They sure have found all sorts of clever ways to keep themselves in place.
Hoppip can also evolve, and it’s quite the sight. Don’t take my word for it—how about you go see for yourself!
What an adorable Skiploom, %PLAYERNAME%! Have you had a moment to study it?
The bloom on top of its head opens and closes as the temperature fluctuates. Because Skiploom’s flower blossoms when the temperature rises, some Trainers have taken to using it as a thermometer. Isn’t that fascinating?
In warm weather, Skiploom can also be seen floating in the air to get closer to the sun. I don’t blame it—if I could float and get a little more sunlight, I would, too!
Did you know that Skiploom can evolve as well? Why don’t you evolve one, hm?
Great work, %PLAYERNAME%! Looks like you’ve got yourself a Jumpluff. Jumpluff rides the winds to cross the sea and fly to foreign lands, scattering cotton spores as it goes.
Wouldn’t it be wonderful to travel so breezily?
On that note, you should take your new friend for a stroll—maybe bask in the sunlight together a bit, too.
See you again soon, %PLAYERNAME%!
Jessie: Hey, James, did you hear?
James: What is it, Jessie?
Jessie: Apparently, there’s a mysterious Pokémon in a jungle nearby!
James: Go on!
Jessie: They say it’s called the Protector of the Jungle or something like that.
James: Oh? That sounds like the kind of Pokémon the Boss would be happy to see!
Jessie: It’s going to be a pain, though, since we don’t really know the area.
James: Hmmm, maybe we can con someone into helping us!
Jessie: Yeah... Huh? Hey, you! You must be an assistant the Boss sent! Yeah, why else would someone be out here in the middle of nowhere?
James: Assistant? Oh! Of course! An assistant! The Boss has high expectations for us, after all. Now that you’re here, let’s get to work.
Jessie: Nice work, kid! I can’t believe you actually did it!
James: Yeah! It feels nice to have somebody to boss around— I mean, uh, somebody to help us out! Jessie and I are constantly on our feet, you know.
Jessie: As you can imagine, it’s hard for us to maintain our good looks when we’re always running around like this. Anyway, you did your bit, so I guess we can let you take a little break.
James: Superb idea, Jessie! It’s important to change up the pace every once in a while!
James: Go on and spend some time with your buddy.
Jessie: I’m so glad the Boss sent along someone so useful to help us!
James: Now that you mention it, you haven’t told us anything about yourself. Where are you normally stationed? How long have you been with Team Rocket? Oh, what’s your favorite thing about the Boss? Do tell!
James: Hey, who exactly are you?
James: ... ... ...
Jessie: You’d better start talking.
Jessie: Aha! I knew you were just a no-good Twerp! This whole thing was suspicious from the start! Did someone send you to get in our way?! Yeah, that must be it!
James: I trusted you! I thought you were one of us!
Jessie: You know too much! We can’t let you go! Let’s get ’em, James!
James: Don’t you dare get in our way! You’ll regret it if you do!
Jessie: Don’t you know who we are?! Well, let us formally introduce ourselves!
Jessie: Prepare for trouble...
James: And make it double!
Jessie: ...
Jessie: To protect the world from devastation!
James: To unite all people— HEY! Are you even listening?!
James: Hey, why so quiet all of a sudden?
James: Jessie, who actually told you that we’d be getting an assistant?
Jessie: Nobody told ME anything!
James: Well, no one told me, either!
Jessie: But you’re the one who said they were sent by the Boss!
James: I said no such thing!
James: ... ... ...
Jessie: I can’t believe we were defeated by a Twerp like you!
James: That was totally unexpected. What will the Boss say...?
James: Huh?!
Jessie: Hey, behind you! Isn’t that Celebi? Could it be the so-called Protector of the Jungle?!
James: Drat! That Pokémon was supposed to be ours!
Jessie: Mark our words...
James: We’ll get you next time!
Jessie: We’re blasting off again!
Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%!
I have an exciting discovery to share with you today. Have you heard of the Legendary Pokémon Cobalion, Terrakion, and Virizion?
Well, it looks like they’ve been challenging Trainers in Raid Battles recently!
Coming face-to-face with any Legendary Pokémon is cause to celebrate, but I’m extra intrigued this time.
Why, you ask? Well, Spark said he saw something peculiar along the waterfront while he was taking pictures earlier—a Pokémon running across the water’s surface!
But the photos he captured are, ah... Let’s just say it’s hard to tell what exactly is in them.
Do you think this could be connected to the appearance of those Legendary Pokémon?
This calls for more research. How about you document your findings with some GO Snapshots? We might be on the trail of something extraordinary!
Thank you, %PLAYERNAME%. Your research will help us dive a bit deeper into what’s currently going on.
Since the Legendary Pokémon we discussed previously have been testing Trainers’ skills in raids, I consulted with Candela, the authority on all things related to battle.
She thinks the current situation points to the Colt Pokémon, Keldeo, making an appearance.
Candela is a bona fide expert on Keldeo, you see.
She said that Cobalion, Terrakion, and Virizion taught this Pokémon how to fight and that it dashes across the world, seeking opportunities to further its training.
No wonder Candela is such a big fan! It’s clear that Keldeo has the drive to improve itself and the passion to accomplish whatever it sets its mind to doing.
Why don’t we take some inspiration from Keldeo and do some training? With such a battle-hardened Pokémon around, we can’t be too prepared.
Wonderful work, %PLAYERNAME%!
While you were battling away, Blanche and I had a moment to dig into some texts and learn more about Keldeo.
Evidently, Keldeo is considered part of a powerful group of Pokémon from the Unova region that includes Cobalion, Terrakion, and Virizion.
This confirms a link between their appearance and Spark’s sighting near the waterfront.
It’s said that Keldeo must survive harsh battles and fully develop the horn on its forehead before its true power will awaken.
Hm. I wonder what this “true power” might be. Let’s investigate the relationship between power and Pokémon by...well, powering up and evolving some Pokémon!
It’s all starting to come together. I think it’s now safe to say our mysterious visitor is indeed the Mythical Pokémon Keldeo!
Blanche and I found more information, too. For starters, Keldeo actually has two forms, one of which is called its “Ordinary Form.”
What’s more, Keldeo can glide across water by blasting water from its hooves—and it excels at using leg moves while battling!
This corroborates both Spark’s sighting and Candela’s knowledge of this Pokémon.
I think I’ll contact them and propose a trip to the waterfront to see if we can gather more information firsthand. Stay tuned!
That was quite the field trip, %PLAYERNAME%, but I bear good news!
The team leaders and I came across fresh Keldeo tracks near the waterfall in Spark’s picture!
Spark, Blanche, and Candela all wanted to the be first to meet the Mythical Pokémon, so they’re battling it out to decide who gets the honor.
And then there’s you. Given what a great Pokémon Trainer you are, I reckon you and Keldeo could achieve some truly marvelous feats together.
Not to undermine our friends, but why don’t you head out with your buddy to see if you can encounter it first?
Amazing, %PLAYERNAME%! You’ve caught the Mythical Pokémon Keldeo!
What an incredible discovery. Thank you for all your help as we followed those clues to their extraordinary end.
Whoa! I can feel Keldeo’s determination to train from here. This Pokémon’s full of drive, just like you!
Don’t keep it waiting—feel free to give yourselves a workout by taking Keldeo to battle other Trainers!
Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%. I can tell that Keldeo enjoyed getting stronger with you.
The team leaders and I are so proud of all the work you’re doing to grow as a Trainer. This only adds to the list of your accomplishments.
And with enough time and training, perhaps we’ll be able to see Keldeo’s other form one day. I’ll keep a blank page in my research notebook ready—no, several pages!
Haha. I suppose that marks the end of this adventure, but you’ll be hearing from me soon, %PLAYERNAME%. Until then, let’s GO!
%PLAYERNAME%! Impeccable timing. I was getting ready to go look for you. There’s something I’d like your help investigating.
This morning, Meltan and I were taking a walk along one of our favorite routes when I noticed that a hill we always pass by seemed...smaller than usual.
There’s only one possibility—Team GO Rocket’s started LITERALLY moving mountains to get their hands on Pokémon! Those scoundrels!
Well, whatever they’re scheming, I’m sure it’s nothing you can’t nip in the bud. Good luck out there, %PLAYERNAME%!
... ... ...Haha! I’m only pulling your leg. In truth, I suspect a Pokémon is responsible.
Take a look around and see if you spot a Pokémon that could be our mountain-moving culprit, would you?
Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%!
Judging from the Pokémon with you, it looks like our mountain-mover must be Larvitar!
This intrepid Pokémon is born deep underground.
To come up to the surface, it needs to eat its way through the soil above. It can’t see its parents’ faces until it does.
That’s hard work for a newborn, but its tough spirit’s something to admire.
I’ll bet that spirit endures in its evolved form, Pupitar. Let’s observe one ourselves, %PLAYERNAME%!
Whoa! I thought I saw something shooting past, %PLAYERNAME%.
Maybe it was another of those shooting stars I keep seeing...but maybe it was your Pupitar!
Pupitar can’t wait to evolve, so it relieves its stress by wildly propelling itself around using compressed gas—almost like a rocket!
Plus, its shell is as hard as sheet rock. Its thrashing can topple a mountain, believe it or not!
Some think of Pupitar as a troublesome Pokémon, but I can relate to its desire to grow.
I know sometimes I’m in a rush to find all the answers and “evolve” my knowledge. It’s how I’ve gotten into more than one scrape.
But even when you’re growing, it’s good to appreciate where you are in life. That goes for you too, %PLAYERNAME%.
Next, let’s take a look at the Pokémon Pupitar is so eager to evolve into!
I thought I felt an earthquake, but it was just your Tyranitar walking around, %PLAYERNAME%!
And look how powerful it’s become—from its humble beginnings burrowing up through the earth to making the surface shake with every stomp.
In fact, Tyranitar is so overwhelmingly powerful that it can bring down a whole mountain to make its nest.
It’s also known to wander about in mountain ranges looking for new opponents to fight.
Luckily, Tyranitar will ignore opponents it doesn’t consider worthy. I’m probably safe!
But it does make you wonder how they’re able to gauge an opponent’s strength.
Hmm... Maybe you’ll get some insight on that as you travel with Tyranitar.
And if you do, be sure to let your favorite professor know! In any case, congratulations on befriending yet another mighty Pokémon.
Thanks for an exciting day of research, %PLAYERNAME%. I’ll see you again soon!
Hey, %PLAYERNAME%! Is it just me, or is there a ghostly chill in the air?
It could have something to do with those lights over there! They belong to Litwick, the Candle Pokémon.
Litwick is known to leech off the life force of any who follow it.
The younger the life this Pokémon absorbs, the brighter and eerier the flame on its head burns. Makes for a pretty ominous candle, wouldn’t you say?
Litwick appearing in such force makes the perfect chance to learn more about them. I suggest you get up close and see for yourself!
Just be careful not to let Litwick lead you anywhere, %PLAYERNAME%!
Good day, Trainer. Professor Willow has tasked you with investigating...Litwick, is it?
The flame on its head is certainly alluring. A Pokémon that can bring light to its surroundings… What could be the source of its brilliant glow?
Life force," Professor Willow says? Peculiar. I wonder—would those flames transform if Litwick were to evolve?
What are your thoughts, %PLAYERNAME%?
Wow, %PLAYERNAME%! You went looking for Litwick and came back with a lamp! 
I kid—I know a Lampent when I see one! And it was Rhi who suggested you help Litwick evolve? That’s great. We can always learn more when encouraged by our friends!
So, let me tell you about Lampent! While it often pretends to be a lamp, Lampent is usually feared as an emissary of death. 
Through cities it wanders, searching for the spirits of the fallen. Spooky, but appropriate for the season! 
And what a sight that fire is. I’m sure you and Rhi would get a kick out of seeing Lampent’s Evolution, Chandelure, too! But a word of caution, %PLAYERNAME%...
They say spirits burned up in Chandelure's ominous flame lose their way and wander this world forever.
That new Pokémon...... ... ...
Oh. My apologies, %PLAYERNAME%. I was...preoccupied gazing at the flame your Pokémon is emanating.
... ... ...
The swaying of its arms is rather hypnotic.
It's called "Chandelure," is it? And Professor Willow said its flames can burn up spirits? An unsettling thought.
The Pokémon we studied today could easily be seen as frightening. Yet I believe there is a lesson we can take from them.
No matter how dark the world becomes, a little light always persists.
Thank you for teaching me that lesson once again, %PLAYERNAME%. Take care, and I will see you again.
Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! Guess what? I was observing a herd of Ponyta last night, and I saw a shooting star! Or maybe it was a spark from fighting Shinx?
In any case, it looks like it was a lucky star—I wished you’d turn up today, and here you are!
Now it’s your turn. What do you wish to research today, %PLAYERNAME%?
Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! Can I just say how impressed I am with your progress as a Trainer?
You’ve really put in the time and effort to become one of the very best. Well done!
Say, do you remember when we first met? You were just a beginner back then, and I sent you off to catch your very first Pokémon.
And look at you now! I’m glad we can share that memory together.
Now, I’m sure an elite Trainer like yourself has mastered the art of catching Pokémon, but it’s important to keep your skills sharp.
How about you head out and catch some Pokémon? I’ve assigned some tasks that should challenge even a Trainer of your caliber.
Good luck—and have fun!
Great work as always, Trainer.
I’m sure those tasks were a breeze for someone with your skills, but they were just a warm-up!
These next tasks should prove a bit more challenging.
I’m sure you’ve built special bonds with several Pokémon over the course of your adventures. You might even have a few Pokémon that you like to always bring into battles.
I’d like to see how powerful those bonds are. Why don’t you head out, challenge a few Team GO Rocket Grunts, and battle in some raids?
After all, the best Trainers never stop training!
Good luck!
How did it go, %PLAYERNAME%?
I’m sure you had a great time working with your closest Pokémon companions.
It’s always fascinating to see how Trainers and Pokémon work together, and I can tell that you take a lot of pride in training your team. Well done!
Say, why don’t you evolve some of the Pokémon you’ve caught so they can reach their full potential? You might even discover some new options for battles.
Enough about that, though—back to our research!
This next batch will test your Pokémon-catching skills again, but with a twist. Or perhaps I should say a curve? Haha! That’s right—you’ll need to test your skills with Curveball Throws!
Make sure to stretch your throwing arm!
Nice work, Trainer! I can tell you put a lot of effort into that research.
I have Blanche assisting me with the analysis and care of all those Pokémon you sent over. It’s an impressive display of your progress, Trainer, and it’s caught Blanche’s eye as well.
Anyway, I should probably get back to work.
But before I go, I want to say how nice it was to reminisce about our first memories as professor and Trainer.
I’m truly proud of you and how much you’ve grown!
I know you’re far from finished on that front, too, so I’ll be watching closely as you progress and checking in whenever I have more challenges for you.
Until then, %PLAYERNAME%...let’s GO!
Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! I wanted to check in on your progress. It looks like you’ve grown even more as a Trainer since we last spoke!
As for me, I’ve been spending a lot of time with my Buddy Pokémon lately, and it’s helped me think of some new research opportunities.
Do you remember your first Buddy Pokémon? I remember mine—it was the mysterious Hex Nut Pokémon Meltan!
I still remember the day it earned its very own Best Buddy ribbon.
That’s a proud moment in any Trainer’s journey, don’t you think?
Meltan and I have been around the block a few times, but I still look forward to the next PokéStop we’ll visit.
Why don’t you and your buddy go out and visit some of your favorite places together?
Hope you enjoyed a few walks together with your buddy, Trainer. Did you come across any interesting PokéStops?
I was inspired to head outdoors myself. I joined Spark and his buddy for a long walk after he won a battle.
I even took a celebratory snapshot to mark the occasion!
Going on walks together can be a great way to strengthen your bond with your Pokémon. It’s also a wonderful form of exercise!
Seeing the bond Spark shares with his Pokémon gave me some ideas for more research. Oh, and Spark also wanted me to let you know that he’s cheering you on!
How about you and your buddy go out for a walk, challenge another Trainer and their Pokémon to battle, and take a few snapshots to capture some fun moments together?
Working hard is important, but so is savoring the memories made along the way! Have fun!
Did you make any fun memories with your Pokémon, %PLAYERNAME%?
I’m always amazed by the variety in the snapshots taken by Trainers from all over the world.
I’m especially fond of ones that capture surprise encounters with Pokémon like Smeargle!
That’s one of the best parts of taking snapshots—you never know what you’re going to see!
Hmm... That reminds me of when Team GO Rocket decided to start showing up in Trainers’ snapshots uninvited. And THAT reminds me of some more research I need your help with!
To start, why don’t you and your buddy get warmed up with some raids? When you’re ready, I think we’ll need some help clearing out the Team GO Rocket Leaders in the area.
They’re always up to something, so it’s good to keep an eye out in case they try to take over any nearby PokéStops. Good luck!
Fantastic work, %PLAYERNAME%.
The Team GO Rocket Leaders are a challenge for most Trainers, but I knew they wouldn’t stand a chance against you and your Buddy Pokémon!
The power of friendship is strong indeed—and just one of many benefits to building relationships with your Pokémon.
The trust between a Trainer and their Pokémon is unlike anything I’ve ever seen. Make sure to cherish it!
I’m glad I was able to check in on your progress, Trainer.
I’ll be back with more fun challenges as you continue your journey.
Until next time!
Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%.
I can see you’ve been working as hard as ever!
We’ve been doing a lot of reminiscing lately, haven’t we? I think it’s important to look back on your accomplishments from time to time—especially when you’ve accomplished so much!
A major moment for many Trainers is their first victory in battle.
It’s an unforgettable thrill that comes with a swell of pride for the Pokémon that sealed the victory.
How about you, %PLAYERNAME%? I’m sure you’ve got some epic battle stories to share with your fellow Trainers.
I’d like to focus on your battling skills for this next challenge. So to prepare, why don’t you get your team sorted and get in some throwing practice?
You clearly have some powerful Pokémon, Trainer.
You’ve done an amazing job training them! I wanted to see how your battling skills have progressed, so I consulted with Candela to get her thoughts.
I’m happy to report that she’s just as proud of you as I am!
For this next challenge, she suggested taking on some of her most difficult opponents—Team GO Rocket and its leaders.
The Team GO Rocket Leaders can be intimidating, so Candela asked me to pass along some extra guidance.
She said that when it comes to battling, you should take on your opponents with a cool head, strong Pokémon, and a heart full of passion.
With that in mind, I think it’s time for you to head out and put your skills to the test!
Wonderful work, %PLAYERNAME%! Your battling skills are even more impressive than the last time we talked.
Those skills are vital not only when you take on Team GO Rocket but also when you battle in raids. Do you remember your first raid, Trainer?
To me, there’s something special about a group of Trainers coming together to challenge a raid with their partner Pokémon.
There’s no questioning the importance of the bonds Trainers share with their Pokémon, but I think the bonds Trainers share with their peers are equally important.
No matter your skill level, what team you’re on, or the Pokémon you bring to battle, raids are about each Trainer working together to achieve a common goal. And that’s what the Trainer community is all about!
I hope that inspired you to head out and challenge some raids with your fellow Trainers—because that’s part of your next task!
It should be a fun challenge, so be sure to give it your best shot!
Excellent work, Trainer.
Did you enjoy spending time with your fellow Trainers as you completed your tasks?
Hopefully you even found a Pokémon that’ll make a great addition to your team!
I hope you continue making memories with Trainers from all over as you work together and explore this amazing world filled with Pokémon.
Very few Trainers have made it as far as you have. Be sure to take a moment to celebrate your progress.
And remember—the journey is just as important as the destination!
Until next time, %PLAYERNAME%!
I knew I’d see you here before long, %PLAYERNAME%.
But before we begin this challenge, let’s take a couple deep breaths together, shall we?
In... And out... One more time. In... And out... There, that’s better.
A few deep breaths go a long way when you need to clear your mind and focus on the task at hand—and you’ll need plenty of focus for what I’ll be throwing your way next.
Get it? “Throwing”? Ahem! Anyway... The sign of a truly great Trainer is their dedication to training, and true dedication takes time to prove.
Your next few tasks will take some time to complete, but don’t worry. Start with a deep breath, and be sure to enjoy yourself!
Training can be hard work, but don’t forget it’s supposed to be fun, too.
Impressive work, Trainer!
I don’t know many who would have the dedication and patience to complete those tasks.
Say, I was just thinking... Do you remember when you decided which team you wanted to join?
Trainers often form a strong connection to their team and become dedicated members. Others, however, eventually look to change teams in hopes of gaining a different perspective and a fresh challenge.
Everyone’s path is different, and I’ll always encourage you to find your own. There’s much to be learned from Team Instinct, Team Mystic, and Team Valor. Each team has its own unique characteristics and focus.
I urge you to learn from your fellow Trainers and respect their paths. It’s sure to help you become a better Trainer! After all, only when we understand others can we truly understand ourselves.
Now, back to your research. I have a feeling this next batch will truly test your resolve, so take your time—we’ll regroup when you’re finished!
Welcome back, Trainer. You certainly showed your dedication by completing those tasks.
Which did you find most difficult? And which was most fun?
We’re approaching the end of this challenge, and I’m not ashamed to say it’s making me a bit emotional! The team leaders and I feel an immense sense of pride when we see how much you’ve grown.
I hope you feel that pride in yourself, %PLAYERNAME%. To wrap up this challenge, each team leader wanted you to experience some of their most beloved activities.
Spark wants you to enjoy a walk with your buddy to enhance your bond, and Blanche hopes to remind you of the importance of research and analysis by asking you to evolve some of your Pokémon to their full potential.
As for Candela... Well, she wants to celebrate with you after you win some raids.
I think these are great tasks for a well-rounded Trainer like yourself. I’ll be here to congratulate you when you’re done!
Amazing. Simply amazing, %PLAYERNAME%! Let me be the first to congratulate you for completing this challenge. You’ve become a truly top-class Trainer, and it’s been an honor to work alongside you.
It’s been astonishing to witness the growth you’ve experienced since you began your journey as a Pokémon Trainer. You’re an incredible talent, and I hope you’ll put your skills to use.
You see, I want you to help other Trainers become the best they can be. Your experience comes with a lot of responsibility, and I hope you’ll continue to show kindness, patience, and friendship to those who could benefit from your guidance.
The world of Pokémon is a beautiful place, and I want you to lead by example and show everyone how amazing our community can be while protecting it from the likes of Team GO Rocket and anyone else who would threaten it.
Remember how it felt the first time you caught a Pokémon, the first time you took a walk with your buddy, the first time you challenged a raid—and channel that energy into everything you do. With your strong heart and peerless determination, there’s nothing you can’t do!
I can only hope you’re as proud of yourself as the team leaders and I are of you. Don’t worry—I’ll always be here when you need me, and you can be sure I’ll be calling on you from time to time to help me with research. There’s always something more to discover, after all!
Thanks for everything, %PLAYERNAME%. I know I can always count on you! And I’m sure you know what I’m about to say, so before I get too choked up—let’s GO!
Ah, %PLAYERNAME%—perfect timing!
Come look at this. See that there, in the dirt?
That’s right—footprints! Though not human ones, I’d wager.
You’d be hard pressed to find shoes that would fit whatever feet made these, I think! There must be a Pokémon responsible, though I’m not sure which one...
I’m going to stick around and see if I can’t learn a bit more from these footprints, so why don’t you follow them and see where they take you?
Make sure to snap some photos of your findings!
Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! That Ground-type Pokémon you caught looks spectacular.
Did you know that Drilbur, the Mole Pokémon, can dig through the ground at incredible speeds?
In the Galar region, Drilbur often leave farmers in a tizzy because they damage their crops. Sounds like mole than they can handle, eh? Haha!
Anyway, while you were out, I received reports that the Pokémon we’re looking for has vines on its body.
How about you search the bushes nearby to see if you can find any vines? Don’t forget to snap some photos, too!
Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%. You got a great shot of that Bug-type Pokémon!
I encountered a curious Bug-type Pokémon myself, actually: Combee.
Known as the Tiny Bee Pokémon, Combee is actually a trio! The three work together to collect honey and deliver it to their colony.
Such abundant teamwork sure is admirable!
I’m sure our team leaders strive to achieve that same level of synergy.
Anyway, the Combee I saw got me thinking: Maybe we’ve been searching too close to the ground. If my hypothesis is correct, we’re on the trail of a Pokémon that can sometimes be seen hopping from tree to tree.
This time, try searching among the trees to see if you can find any leads. And don’t forget to photograph your findings!
Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! Sweet Nuzleaf.
I believe the Pokémon we’re after tends to live deep in forests—much like Nuzleaf does—so we should be on the right track.
Ah, look—your Nuzleaf just started playing its grass flute!
The sound of it is said to make its listeners uneasy. I wonder if it’s trying to lead the Pokémon out into the open...
Wait, what was that?
Look there! A dark shadow just dashed across the sky! Keep your eyes up, %PLAYERNAME%, and chase after it! Let’s GO!
Great job out there, %PLAYERNAME%!
The photo you sent me speaks to your efforts. And I see you made a new friend in that Rufflet!
Did you know that Rufflet will challenge Pokémon stronger than itself, even if it might lose? That’s how it pushes itself to grow!
Pretty brave, huh? I think bravery is exactly what we’ll need as we prepare to encounter the mysterious Pokémon we’ve been tracking.
Thanks to all the information we’ve gathered, I’m certain that we’re dealing with Zarude, the Rogue Monkey Pokémon.
The Mythical Pokémon Zarude tend to live in packs in the forest, but it looks like the one we’ve been following is all on its own.
Sounds like the perfect chance to catch it, don’t you think?
With everything we’ve learned—and all the Pokémon friends you’ve made along the way—I’m sure you’ll succeed!
...
Oh! %PLAYERNAME%, you caught me by surprise. I was just thinking about some movies I’ve seen recently.
What, you didn’t take me for a movie guy? Haha! Well, while the world of Pokémon is my greatest passion, I’ve been trying to explore my interests outside of research and Pokémon as well.
Self-discovery is important for personal growth in all walks of life. It can also be quite fun! I’ve learned that I really enjoy watching a film to pass the time now and again.
Also, a lot of movies feature Pokémon! Don’t you love it when your interests overlap?
I saw an incredibly thrilling action movie the other day. It was about a fighter who, against all odds, becomes a professional boxer alongside his trusty Machop.
Life had him on the ropes, but he just kept punching back! Talk about inspiring.
Did you know that Machop love to work out and build their muscles? They’re never satisfied, even when they train hard all day long! I wish I had that energy when I do fieldwork!
Speaking of Machop: Did you notice that more of them are appearing in the wild? That’s what reminded me of that movie in the first place!
Could you head out and learn more about Machop?
Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! Great job catching all those Machop. I wonder if you’ll grow as close as the two characters in that movie.
The main character started in a pretty tough place, but his Machop kept him motivated and inspired.
Then, he was given an incredible opportunity to compete against other fighters. My favorite part was when his Machop evolved into Machoke!
Isn’t the relationship between a Trainer and their Pokémon wonderful? Machoke are truly remarkable Pokémon, too.
A Machoke’s muscular body is so powerful, the Pokémon must wear a power-save belt to regulate its motions.
As it happens, you should have enough Machop Candies now to evolve Machop into a Machoke of your own. It’s almost like you’re living out that movie yourself!
Wow—that’s one muscular Machoke! Great work evolving it.
Sometimes, Machoke will head to fields and mountains to exercise and train. Isn’t that dedication amazing?
It reminds me of a training montage in that film. The Trainer and his Machoke traveled to the mountains to train together.
Watching their friendship blossom almost moved me to tears! The way they encouraged each other reminded me why I love Pokémon, especially when the Machoke evolved into Machamp!
Oops, there I go again… Anyway, Machop and Machoke are very impressive Pokémon, but Machamp is on an entirely different level.
Its four arms react more quickly than it can think, so Machamp can execute several punches at once!
Hoo-hah! That was the movie Machamp’s signature move. Haha, who knew I’d become such a film buff? Get it? Buff?
Moving right along…
How about you do a bit of research on Machamp? Your Machoke seems pumped to get stronger. Let’s try evolving it into Machamp and see what happens!
Wow, %PLAYERNAME%! I saw you approaching with your newly evolved Machamp, and I almost couldn’t believe my eyes. It was just like the end of that movie!
The Trainer ended up winning the tournament, and he couldn’t have done it without his Machamp by his side.
Movies are so powerful! Especially ones about Pokémon and their Trainers.
I suppose you and Machamp don’t need to watch that particular film, though—you practically lived it today! It’s been inspiring to witness, and I hope to carry that inspiration with me as I grow closer to my own Pokémon.
You never know what you’ll discover about yourself when you try new things—just like how you never know which Pokémon you’ll end up forming a lifelong friendship with until you catch them!
Thanks for coming along with me on this journey, Trainer. I wish you and your Machamp well, and I’ll see you next time. Let’s GO!
Good to see you, %PLAYERNAME%! Do you hear that sound?
All morning, I’ve been hearing the distinct sound of splashing water. While somewhat relaxing, it’s definitely not a normal thing to hear around the lab.
Upon further investigation, I noticed an increased number of Magikarp in the wild. It was quite the sight to see so many of them splashing about.
Guess it’s time to GO fishing! Get it? Because Magikarp is the Fish Pokémon?
Anyway, I think it’ll be safe to approach Magikarp, as documentation indicates they’re harmless.
However, I see potential in this Pokémon. It’s time to head out and investigate.
Great work, Trainer! While you were out, I did a bit of a refresher on Magikarp.
Did you know that some Magikarp can jump so high, they can leap over a mountain? Now that’s something I’d like to see!
Also, while having a reputation for being worthless, this hardy Pokémon can thrive in any body of water, regardless of how dirty or polluted the water might be.
I think Magikarp deserves a bit more credit, don’t you think? Let’s focus on evolving Magikarp, since doing so takes some effort.
Maybe you should try using Pinap Berries when trying to catch Magikarp. Not only are Pinap Berries tasty, but they’re quite useful as well!
Good job, %PLAYERNAME%. Thanks to the research you’ve completed, it’s time to evolve that Magikarp of yours!
Remember when I said that Magikarp is harmless? Well, that isn’t the case with its evolved form, Gyarados.
Known as the Atrocious Pokémon, Gyarados has a reputation for being destructive. Tales of its rampaging nature are consistent across all research materials we have on it.
So much for being harmless, am I right? Of note, Gyarados is both Water- and Flying-type—something you might not expect from its humble beginnings.
Looks like you’ll be adding a powerful Pokémon to your team, but let’s proceed with caution.
Wonderful work, %PLAYERNAME%. Looks like all your efforts have paid off, and you’ve got yourself a Gyarados.
I’m sure this Pokémon will be a great member of your team when battling other Trainers or even Team GO Rocket!
Even though Gyarados is known for being vicious and extremely aggressive, a talented Trainer such as yourself will be able to befriend and train it so it can meet its full potential.
I’m excited to see what kinds of challenges you’ll demolish together!
Just make sure that the demolition is limited to battles—not entire cities.
Anyway, until next time!
Ah, %PLAYERNAME%! Perfect timing. I’ve just encountered something strange!
I’ve been feeling a bit warm lately, so I walked to a nearby clearing to enjoy the cool breeze—but the temperature seemed to rise as I arrived!
Curious, isn’t it? I suspect it’s the work of a certain Pokémon.
There’s one that’s known to dislike cold areas so much, it’ll blow scorching flames to heat up its surroundings.
I believe there are large groups of this particular Pokémon appearing all over the place right now.
Ah, you’re wondering which Pokémon I’m talking about? I think I’ll keep that to myself for now. But here—I'll write it on this piece of paper, and we can check later to see if I was right!
Can you go investigate and let me know what you find? Thanks, Trainer!
Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%.
As promised, I’ll now reveal my guess as to which Pokémon is responsible for these recent temperature spikes. As you can see, I wrote down...Magmar!
My intuition is pretty “lit,” eh? Am I using that ri—AH! Wow, that little fireball turned my paper straight to ash!
Anyway, it seems the cause of these irregular warm fronts is indeed Magmar, the Spitfire Pokémon.
When it breathes deeply, heat waves form around its body, making it hard to see clearly. Isn’t that just incredible?
And to think that this intimidating Pokémon evolves from the adorable Magby, the Live Coal Pokémon!
As adorable as Magby is, though, field studies have shown that whenever it inhales and exhales, hot embers dribble out of its mouth and nostrils. Still doesn’t stop me from trying to hug it!
Anyway, %PLAYERNAME%, you should try evolving your Magmar! Check in with me again before you do, though—I’ll have more hot tips for you then.
You’re almost there, %PLAYERNAME%!
Soon, you’ll have yourself a Magmortar, the Blast Pokémon. Exciting stuff!
Watch out for the ends of its arms, though—they can produce fireballs as hot as 3,600 degrees Fahrenheit! Yowch!
Can you imagine if you could blast fireballs out of your arms? Fwoosh! Fwoosh! Hahaha! Hey, that’s pretty fun! Fwoosh!
There I go getting fired up about Pokémon again. Get it? “Fired up”? Haha, my hot streak continues!
Anyway, with this Sinnoh Stone and the Magmar Candy you’ve acquired, you should be able to evolve your Magmar into Magmortar pretty soon—so keep up the great work, %PLAYERNAME%!
Excellent work, %PLAYERNAME%! Looks like you’ve got your very own Magmortar.
Magmortar, like Magby and Magmar, tends to live in volcanos.
Its body can even take on a whitish hue from the intense heat generated by the fireballs it shoots from the ends of its arms!
Wow, learning about Magmar and its Evolutionary line has really lit a fire in my heart. I need to get back to my research, pronto!
See you around, %PLAYERNAME%!
%PLAYERNAME%! Good to see you. How’ve you been? Rested and relaxed, I hope?
I’ve been full of energy since I saw Tapu Fini. And as I thought more about that encounter, I realized that over these past few months, we’ve been seeing quite a few Pokémon that were first found in Alola.
And you—you’ve even been lucky enough to see all four of Alola’s island guardians!
I can’t say I’m completely free of envy, but I’m glad you were able to have those experiences.
After all, we professors owe much of our learning to adventurous Trainers like yourself!
I wonder if our friendship would be as fruitful if our roles were reversed... I’d sure like to hope so! Haha!
Keep exploring, %PLAYERNAME%. You never know what you might find!
Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! Look at that—you’ve caught all of Alola’s first partner Pokémon!
They make for quite the iconic trio.
Let’s continue our Alola-inspired research today!
Which of Alola’s islands piques your interest the most, %PLAYERNAME%?
So you’re interested in Melemele Island, eh? No surprise there—it’s one of my favorites as well.
Though perhaps that isn’t saying much... They’re all my favorites, really! Haha!
As we’ve discussed, Melemele Island is where many Trainers in Alola begin the region’s island challenge.
There’s even a Trainers’ School there, where aspiring young Trainers can make friends and study up on all things Pokémon.
In the spirit of Melemele Island, why don’t you go meet some new Pokémon and send some Gifts to your friends?
So you’re interested in Akala Island, eh? No surprise there—it’s one of my favorites as well.
Though perhaps that isn’t saying much... They’re all my favorites, really! Haha!
As I mentioned before, Akala Island offers a variety of geological features, including a volcano, fishing spots, and even waterfalls!
I like to take a stroll when my mind gets mired in a problem, and it sounds like Akala Island would be a great place for that.
In that spirit, why don’t you take a stroll yourself? I’ll be here when you get back.
So you’re interested in Ula’Ula Island, eh? No surprise there—it’s one of my favorites as well.
Though perhaps that isn’t saying much... They’re all my favorites, really! Haha!
As we’ve discussed, Ula’Ula Island is home to Mount Lanakila, the highest peak in all of Alola! But did you know the summit of Mount Lanakila also houses Alola’s very own Pokémon League?
It’s a place many Trainers aspire to reach, and doing so requires forging powerful bonds with Pokémon.
In that spirit, why don’t you head out and find some new Pokémon partners, %PLAYERNAME%?
So you’re interested in Poni Island, eh? No surprise there—it’s one of my favorites as well.
Though perhaps that isn’t saying much... They’re all my favorites, really! Haha!
Did you know that Poni Island is home to the Battle Tree, Alola’s preeminent battle facility? Strong Trainers gather there to test their teams against each other.
I’ve heard you can even meet some Pokémon League Champions there on occasion! The things I could learn from them...
In the spirit of Poni Island—and as an act of public service—why don’t you test your battling skills against Team GO Rocket, %PLAYERNAME%?
I don’t know about you, but I’ve had a great time getting to learn more about Alola, its Pokémon, and even its guardian deities.
If there’s one thing I love about Pokémon, it’s that there’s always something new to learn!
But to be honest with you, I was hoping we’d have a better idea by now of what attracted Alola’s guardian deities here.
They usually spend their time protecting Alola, so what could’ve spurred them to come here?
Could it be that they sensed something dangerous nearby that may threaten Alola? It would have to be something extraordinary—maybe even beyond our current understanding of Pokémon.
Another daunting yet fascinating question for us to tackle together, %PLAYERNAME%.
Whatever comes next, I know the two of us will overcome it.
For now, continue your island research. I’ll keep trying to spot the guardian deities!
I’ll be in touch again soon. For now, let’s GO!
Welcome back! Did your friends like their Gifts?
Welcome back! How was your adventure? Did you see anything new? You’ll have to tell me all about it!
Welcome back! Let me take a look at the Pokémon you’ve returned with... I bet with some training, you and your Pokémon would be ready to take on Alola’s Pokémon League yourselves!
Welcome back! I knew you’d have no trouble with Team GO Rocket. You never do!
... ... ... *sigh* ... ... ...
Oh. Hey, %PLAYERNAME%.
... ... ... *sigh*
Sorry. I’ve just been feeling kinda burnt out lately.
I hate to say it, but my battling techniques have gotten stale. I need to reignite my inner fire somehow.
Wait—I’ve got an idea! Professor Willow’s always talking about how great you are at Pokémon battles.
How about letting me see some of that passion in action? Watching you battle might be just what I need!
You’ll help me out, yeah? Nice. I knew you’d agree, %PLAYERNAME%.
Let’s make sure our teams are in top shape, then we’ll get to it.
I’m all set, %PLAYERNAME%.
My team’s raring to see you and your Pokémon blaze into the fray!
So. Where should we start? There’s plenty of options—take on a Gym, battle with friends, go a couple rounds in the GO Battle League...
You and I could even go head-to-head!
Oh—I’ve got it! See that Team GO Rocket Grunt over there?
Let’s take ’em down. We can save whatever Pokémon they’ve got their hands on and flex your battle skills at the same time!
You’re on fire, %PLAYERNAME%!
Didja see how fast that Grunt ran off? Hah! You smoked ’em.
Speaking of Grunts, they’ve been acting weird lately. The last few I battled acted off after I beat ’em. Usually they throw a huffy quip at me before sulking off.
But lately they just laugh!
Rrrgh... Think I need to up the intensity? Maybe have Ponyta give ’em a good Stomp at the end?!
Anyway. Enough analyzing—that’s Blanche’s thing. Let’s get back to battling. Why don’t we find a Gym you can take on.
That was a blistering battle, %PLAYERNAME%!
My mind’s ablaze with new ways to train.
Thanks for helping me find my fire!
I should probably be the one teaching you stuff, but you know plenty already.
Does that mean you’re looking to take up the reins of team leader yourself? Hah, I could get behind that!
You know, you really gave me the inspiration I needed—I’d say that’s pretty heroic.
All right. Enough talk. Ponyta and I are off to get in some training. See you later, %PLAYERNAME%! And you better be ready to battle the next time you see me.
Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! I think I’ve got an exciting adventure for you. I’ve been working on something...BIG.
Recently, we observed a large number of Weedle appearing in the wild. I wanted to investigate that phenomenon further.
After a day of research, I saw something sparkling in the tall grass near where the Weedle were gathering.
It turned out to be a smooth, stonelike object with a symbol etched into it. It glowed with an energy I’ve never encountered before!
I’d seen that symbol before in documents about Mega Evolution that I received from my colleague in Kalos, Professor Sycamore. That led me to believe that the object was somehow related.
After digging further into the documents, I theorized that Pokémon can Mega Evolve using the energy from the object I found, which I named Mega Energy.
It also occurred to me that the object I found might be related to Weedle.
Now that I’ve caught you up on my BIG discovery, let’s get started on some research. We’ll need a Weedle—I think that Pokémon has mega potential!
Great work, %PLAYERNAME%! Let’s document our findings for other Trainers.
Now, Weedle can’t Mega Evolve, but its final Evolution, Beedrill, can.
My theory is that there is Mega Energy for different Pokémon and that each Pokémon needs a certain amount of Mega Energy to Mega Evolve.
It also seems that Mega-Evolved Pokémon return to normal once their Mega Energy is depleted.
It may be difficult to gather the Mega Energy needed to Mega Evolve a Pokémon for the first time. However, it seems that once a Pokémon has Mega Evolved, it requires less Mega Energy to do so again.
Maybe it’s because Mega Evolution strengthens a Trainer’s bond with their Pokémon.
Let’s continue this investigation. How about you evolve your Weedle to its final Evolution and see whether you can find enough Mega Energy to Mega Evolve your new Beedrill.
Again, you never cease to amaze me, %PLAYERNAME%. I think you and Beedrill are going to be great partners.
I’ve learned that some other Pokémon can Mega Evolve, too.
While I’ve been able to confirm only a few, I’m sure we’ll discover more in time. At this point, you should be able to Mega Evolve your Beedrill, if you’re ready.
Now, I’m sure you are going to ask, “Professor Willow, how do I get Mega Energy for other Pokémon?”
Well, don’t worry, Trainer. Mega Venusaur, Mega Charizard, and Mega Blastoise are appearing in Mega Raids all around the world. It appears you can get Mega Energy by challenging those Mega-Evolved Pokémon.
Why don’t you Mega Evolve your Beedrill and battle with it in Mega Raids? There seem to be benefits to battling in raids alongside Mega-Evolved Pokémon for both you and your fellow Trainers.
I’m curious to see what effect Mega-Evolved Pokémon have on other Pokémon when they battle together. Why don’t you give it a try!
I dare say, this was a successful research project! It looks like you were able to acquire some Mega Energy by battling those Mega-Evolved Pokémon.
I’ve documented that you and your Mega-Evolved Pokémon can do many other things together, too.
I hope to see you and your Mega-Evolved Pokémon battling at Gyms, challenging other Trainers, combating Team GO Rocket, and, of course, taking some snapshots to send back to yours truly.
Mega-Evolved Pokémon are extremely powerful, so I think it’s best that we don’t bring our new friends into the GO Battle League just yet, at least until more research is done.
I wanted to give you a token of my appreciation for all your hard work on this project—a Mega Bracelet!
In other regions, Trainers use Mega Bracelets to help their Pokémon Mega Evolve. Based on my research into Mega Energy, it seems you won’t need a Mega Bracelet to Mega Evolve your Pokémon.
However, I thought a Mega Bracelet would be a trendy way to show off your Mega Evolution skills.
You can check it out when you want to change up your look. I hope you accept this gift with my sincerest thanks for a job well done.
Until next time, let’s GO!
Hello there, %PLAYERNAME%!
I have something exciting planned for you today—you could even say it’s a mega surprise! Haha!
I still have a few loose ends to wrap up, though.
While I finish my preparations, how about you take a quick survey of the area and see what Pokémon are out and about today?
I’ll be ready by the time you’re back.
Ah, good—you’re back. I’ve just finished getting everything ready.
Have you tried to Mega Evolve a Pokémon lately?
Something about Mega Evolution caught my attention recently, so I was hoping you could help me investigate.
Let’s take a closer look at Mega Evolution, from beginning to end.
First, let’s choose which of these Pokémon you’d like to be the star of our research, %PLAYERNAME%!
Once we’re done, our understanding of Mega Evolution will be second to none.
So, you’ve chosen Venusaur, the Seed Pokémon!
Venusaur absorbs solar energy as nutrition. By spreading the broad petals of its flower and catching the sun’s rays, it fills its body with power.
While I fetch Venusaur, how about you go out and catch a few Pokémon as a warm-up. Don’t forget to power them up, too.
You’ll have an even more formidable team by your side in no time!
So, you’ve chosen Charizard, the Flame Pokémon!
Its bond with its Trainer is the source of its power. It boasts speed and maneuverability greater than that of a jet fighter.
While I fetch Charizard, how about you go out and catch a few Pokémon as a warm-up. Don’t forget to power them up, too.
You’ll have an even more formidable team by your side in no time!
So, you’ve chosen Blastoise, the Shellfish Pokémon!
The jets of water it spouts from the rocket cannons on its shell can punch through thick steel.
While I fetch Blastoise, how about you go out and catch a few Pokémon as a warm-up. Don’t forget to power them up, too.
You’ll have an even more formidable team by your side in no time!
Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! Now that we’re fully warmed up, let’s tuck into our research on Mega Evolution.
Some theorize that a strong bond between a Trainer and a Pokémon is the key to Mega Evolution. We’ve also seen that Mega Energy can play a role.
However, I noticed recently that if you Mega Evolve your Pokémon once using Mega Energy, you won’t need to use Mega Energy to Mega Evolve that Pokémon again.
Let’s Mega Evolve Venusaur and see if that’s true for ourselves, %PLAYERNAME%!

However, I noticed recently that if you Mega Evolve your Pokémon once using Mega Energy, you won’t need to use Mega Energy to Mega Evolve that Pokémon again.
Let’s Mega Evolve Blastoise and see if that’s true for ourselves, %PLAYERNAME%!
What a magnificent Mega Venusaur, %PLAYERNAME%!
Let’s keep growing: why don’t you take on a Raid Battle with your mighty Mega Venusaur? There may even be a Team GO Rocket Grunt lurking about, looking for a battle.
Mega-Evolved Pokémon are powerful allies. Their strength in battle is unmatched!
I’m sure there’s more to learn about Mega Evolution, so why stop now? Let’s GO!
What a commanding Mega Charizard, %PLAYERNAME%!
Let’s keep our fire burning: why don’t you take on a Raid Battle with your mighty Mega Charizard? There may even be a Team GO Rocket Grunt lurking about, looking for a battle.
Mega-Evolved Pokémon are powerful allies. Their strength in battle is unmatched!
I’m sure there’s more to learn about Mega Evolution, so why stop now? Let’s GO!
What a brilliant Mega Blastoise, %PLAYERNAME%!
Let’s keep our progress flowing: why don’t you take on a Raid Battle with your mighty Mega Blastoise? There may even be a Team GO Rocket Grunt lurking about, looking for a battle.
Mega-Evolved Pokémon are powerful allies. Their strength in battle is unmatched!
I’m sure there’s more to learn about Mega Evolution, so why stop now? Let’s GO!
Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! It’s great to see you, as always.
I’m feeling especially refreshed today, as if a pleasant island breeze was following me. Maybe it’s the freshly squeezed Pinap Juice I had for breakfast?
Or maybe it’s because more and more Pokémon first discovered in the Alola region have been coming to visit me lately!
Do you know about the Alola region, %PLAYERNAME%? It’s a cluster of tropical islands, each with unique scenery and Pokémon.
Alola even has Pokémon whose appearances are different than their counterparts in other regions. You may have encountered some of them before!
Why don’t you try looking for some Pokémon that were first discovered in Alola while I rustle up another glass of juice? I’m sure we have a lot to learn about our visitors!
Good timing, %PLAYERNAME%! I just finished my juice.
Thanks for looking into the Alola region’s Pokémon! You’re as diligent as ever.
Let me take a look at what you’ve discovered. Hmm... It seems many of the Pokémon you just met can be found on Alola’s Melemele Island.
Melemele Island is where many of Alola’s Trainers begin their island challenge. It’s very fitting that the Pokémon you just met are also some of the first that young Trainers in Alola meet, too!
Now, let’s have a little more fun! Could you take a few snapshots of your new Pokémon friends or feed them some Berries, %PLAYERNAME%?
Back already, %PLAYERNAME%? You and your Pokémon already seem to be closer. But who doesn’t love a good Pinap Berry? Speaking of, maybe it’s time for another glass of juice...
Delicious juice aside, did you know that each island in the Alola region has its own Island Guardian? Melemele Island’s guardian deity is Tapu Koko.
Why do I bring this up? Well, while you were away, I was looking for a clean glass and caught a startling yellow flash out of the corner of my eye!
The lightning-wielding Tapu Koko is known to fly faster than the eye can follow. With so many other Pokémon found on Melemele Island appearing, could it be that Tapu Koko is visiting as well?
Could you look around and see if you can spot Tapu Koko, %PLAYERNAME%? I’m eager to know if what I saw was truly the Land Spirit Pokémon.
Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! What’s that? You were able to see Tapu Koko? That’s incredible!
And would you believe it: Spark was just here, raving that he’d seen Tapu Koko, too! So it is in the area after all. What an exceptional discovery, %PLAYERNAME%!
I wonder why Tapu Koko is here. Tapu Koko is said to be a Pokémon brimming with curiosity—but, naturally, island guardians tend to stay on their respective islands. The fact that one of them is here may mean something is amiss...
Or did someone do something to anger it? I’ll have to do some more research before I can say anything for sure.
Do you think we’ll get a chance to meet the other island guardians, %PLAYERNAME%? Wouldn’t that be something.
I guess we’ll just have to wait and see. Until then, let’s kick back and enjoy a little R and R with our new friends!
Hey, %PLAYERNAME%! Have you run into any Pokémon wearing fun costumes recently? I’ve seen quite a few around my mobile lab.
It reminded me how freeing it can be to express yourself in different ways. Personally, I’m a big fan of turning up my tunes and shredding on the air guitar!
Others, like Spark, are really into taking snapshots of Pokémon and the world around them. I wonder how those Pokémon feel when they wear those costumes.
Sounds to me like some research is in order!
Welcome back, Trainer! I was digging through some old files while you were out when I began to hear a strange melody coming from somewhere nearby.
I ran out to investigate, and in my haste, I ended up bumping straight into Blanche, who’d been sorting through some Berries.
Blanche was none too pleased to see those Berries scattered on the ground, but the costumed Pokémon that rushed in to gobble them up sure seemed thankful. Haha!
Seeing them relish those Berries gave me an idea. Cooking food can be a terrific way to express yourself, and giving food to those we care about is one of the most heartfelt things we do for one another.
I wonder how different Pokémon react to different foods. While I go on a Berry run, why don’t you do some research on how Pokémon feel after eating?
Thanks for completing those research tasks, Trainer! Reading the results of your research made my heart full—and my stomach rumbly! Haha!
Ah, by the way! I heard that mysterious melody again while I was collecting Berries. I think it may be the product of a certain Pokémon.
I wasn’t able to look into it further at the time—my hands were quite full with Berries—but I’m hoping we can investigate it together soon.
For now, could you continue researching how people and Pokémon express themselves?
For many Trainers and their Pokémon, battling is a primary outlet of self-expression. In fact, Candela believes that the feelings she shares with her Pokémon can directly influence the outcome of a battle.
Why don’t you go out and see for yourself? I’ll be cheering you on from here!
Welcome back, Trainer. Did you learn anything about expressing yourself in battle?
While you were out, I managed to track that mysterious melody to a location nearby. I think the source may be none other than Meloetta, the Melody Pokémon!
Did you know that its melodies are sung with a special vocalization method that can control the feelings of those who hear it?
Maybe if we find a way to express ourselves through song as well, you’ll be able to catch Meloetta’s attention! What do you say, %PLAYERNAME%?
Well done, %PLAYERNAME%! I knew you’d find a way to catch Meloetta’s attention.
They say many famous songs have been inspired by the melodies that Meloetta produces, and it’s not hard to see why. Self-expression through song is a truly powerful thing!
I think this would be a fine opportunity for you to partner with Meloetta and share who you are with your friends. I’m sure Meloetta would be happy to learn more about you, too!
Da da da dooo... Da dee doo, dee da dee dum...
Oh, %PLAYERNAME%—I didn’t see you there! I was just rocking out to one of my favorite songs. After so much research on how people express themselves, I felt compelled to indulge in a bit of self-expression myself!
Whether it’s serving looks or serving lunch, a Pokémon battle or battle of the bands, there’s no limit to the ways you can express who you are. What’s your method of choice, %PLAYERNAME%?
Maybe you’re still figuring it out—and that’s totally fine. Everyone’s journey is unique! Whatever the case, you have my support—and Meloetta’s, too. Now, let’s get out there and show the world who we are!
%PLAYERNAME%, it’s always great to see you! I’m sure you know this, but your help in progressing my research has been essential to major breakthroughs in my work.
That’s why I’ve come to talk to you again. You probably already know what I’ll be asking!
I need your assistance in learning more about the newly discovered Pokémon that has really sent me and other Pokémon researchers into quite a tizzy.
Can you believe an undiscovered Pokémon just appeared out of the blue? You can imagine how everyone is talking about it!
I was checking a nearby habitat when I ran into a nest of them, and I was so excited, I dropped my camera! Don’t worry, though... I’m sure the repairs won’t cost me too much at the shop...
Although each Pokémon turned out to be a Ditto using the move Transform, that didn’t put a damper on my day!
So many Ditto taking on this unique Pokémon form must mean that the real Pokémon is truly out there, just waiting to be found.
Let’s get to work, %PLAYERNAME%! I know we don’t have much to go on, but I’m confident your hard work can only bring us good fortune!
But first, let me recalibrate my instruments for your area. Could you please complete the following tasks?{0}{1}{2}
Thanks, %PLAYERNAME%! I think that will be enough to help me properly conduct calculations based on the data you’ll gather in the field.
While you were out, I scanned some academic journals to see if any of my fellow researchers have encountered a Pokémon matching the description of the species I saw, but I didn’t have much luck.
But I do have a hunch! Given that this Pokémon has been unseen until just recently, I think it’s safe to say that we’re tracking another Mythical Pokémon, like Mew and Celebi.
If I’m right and this elusive Pokémon is a Mythical Pokémon, we should be able to draw it out by creating specific conditions under which it thrives.
But let’s step back for a minute, before we take a step forward. Or many steps forward, in this case! Great fieldwork starts with a walk. Could you complete a few tasks for me?
Also, remind me to contact my mentor, Professor Oak. I’m certain his brilliant mind will have something to lend to all this...
Please complete the following tasks.{0}{1}{2}
%PLAYERNAME%, I gave Professor Oak a call, and he pulled through! He says that the Pokémon is called Meltan! I think the name has a nice ring to it—don’t you?
Professor Oak got this information through an ancient text found in his archives, which included the appearance of Meltan.
What luck! Did you know that when Professor Oak was my instructor, he was my role model? And he still is!
He and I are of the same opinion that Meltan is a Mythical Pokémon, so I really think we’re on to something!
Still, a name alone isn’t going to get us very far... Perhaps the Ditto know something we don’t?
I think that if we find Ditto, we’ll be able to figure out how they acquired this curious transformation, and maybe that will lead us to Meltan.
Observation will be the best way forward, so let’s roll up our sleeves and get to work!
Please complete the following tasks.{0}{1}{2}
Excellent work, %PLAYERNAME%! The Ditto you’ve helped me analyze indeed has transformed into Meltan before. In fact, it was able to use Transform and let me analyze Meltan up close!
This Ditto was very helpful, even though it couldn’t replicate some of the finer details. It seems the memory of Meltan is fading away...
But I have good news! I was able to tell that Meltan has a liquid-metal body with a nutlike head and a tail that looks like a power cord. Judging from the appearance, it may be an Electric- or Steel-type Pokémon.
In order to make more progress, I think we should study these types of Pokémon! Can you complete the following tasks?{0}{1}{2}
Great news, %PLAYERNAME%! Thanks to all the data you’ve collected, I was able to make a detailed study of the differences between Electric-type Pokémon and Steel-type Pokémon.
Thankfully, the Ditto was able to use Transform one more time! It took me some time to figure out it was attracted to all my metal equipment.
Then I realized that it was copying every aspect of Meltan, including its behavioral patterns. Given the Ditto’s behavior, I believe Meltan is capable of assimilating metal by melting metal objects. What an interesting ability!
I can now say that, according to my research, Meltan is a Steel-type Pokémon!
I think our next step is to study more Pokémon that have similar characteristics. Can you complete the following tasks to learn more about Pokémon with fluid body surfaces or stomach acid strong enough to melt metals?
{0}{1}{2}
Oh, and one more thing—Professor Oak is also studying a Ditto in his own lab that is able to Transform into Meltan. With our parallel research, I think we’ll be able to make some breakthroughs soon!
By the time you complete all the research tasks, I should be able to circle back to you with the latest development.
Just in the nick of time, %PLAYERNAME%! With careful study of the Ditto that I sent him and the small amount of documented Meltan encounters, Professor Oak was able to solve more mysteries related to this Pokémon.
Meltan very well may have split from a Pokémon named Melmetal, which has been recorded even less than Meltan. Never before have we seen a Mythical Pokémon that can divide into multiple, independent Pokémon!
This explains why the world saw a simultaneous appearance of so many Ditto disguised as Meltan.
Professor Oak and I have made a guess as to how Meltan can re-form back into Melmetal—because Meltan have bodies similar to molten metal, they have a unique ability to merge and trigger an Evolution into Melmetal!
Do you know what Pokémon we should research next? You’re bright, %PLAYERNAME%, so I know you know the answer! I need you to collect data on Pokémon for which several parts can come together and act as one.
Can you complete the following tasks?{0}{1}{2}
Wow, I’m impressed! %PLAYERNAME%! Your data has arrived just as I’ve finished putting pieces of evidence together to learn Melmetal’s place in history.
According to these records, Melmetal was once regarded as a sacred being in a secluded community deep inside a wooded land that was rich with magnetite-bearing sedimentary rock.
People there developed ways to make unique tools out of metal shed by Melmetal. Without such metal, they couldn’t have made these tools back then.
We need to find out more about Pokémon that wield tools. Could you complete the following research tasks?{0}{1}{2}
I just received an important piece of news, %PLAYERNAME%! Remember the ancient text? It seems that a mysterious box was also excavated from the same site where the ancient text was found.
There was nothing in the box except a rusty lump of metal that bears interesting similarities to Meltan.
Perhaps exposing the box to this vast natural environment could cause something enigmatic to happen, resulting in Meltan changing states as well.
Exposing this metal to the open air could have had an entirely different effect on what’s inside the box, but we won’t know until we try it.
We may be able to find a clue about the lump of metal by delving into the world of ancient Pokémon.
Please complete the following tasks.{0}{1}{2}
I was right, %PLAYERNAME%! This artifact is truly Meltan! We did it!
Of course, the reason for Meltan’s presence inside this mysterious box can only be guessed. Maybe the people who glorified and worshiped Melmetal decided to keep it safe when the Pokémon somehow split itself apart.
Doing so could have been thought of as the only way for the people to ever meet Melmetal again. That warms the heart a little, doesn’t it, %PLAYERNAME%?
Make sure you give Meltan plenty of chances to see the vast world we live in by venturing out and exploring! Who knows what will happen from here...
Enjoy exploring, %PLAYERNAME%, and I’m sure we’ll be in touch soon!
%PLAYERNAME%, how are you? It’s been a while, hasn’t it? You’ve become quite the Trainer!
I wanted to ask for your help. As you know, I study Pokémon and their habitats. I’ve learned a lot over the years, but recently, I’ve found some hints of something mysterious.
I was wondering if you would help me investigate what's going on.
You will? That’s great!
First things first, let’s calibrate my instruments to your area.
Could you please complete the following research tasks?{0}{1}{2}
Great. Thanks, %PLAYERNAME%! Now I should be able to detect anything out of the ordinary.
I believe we need to be on the lookout for a Mythical Pokémon! Mythical Pokémon are extremely rare and unique, and many consider their existence to be mere rumor.
Could you help get my equipment set up around your local habitat? This’ll be a great time to take your buddy out to explore a bit and hatch some Eggs!
Please complete the following research tasks.{0}{1}{2}
Incredible! This confirms my initial suspicion. I think we’re seeing evidence of Mew!
A Pokémon found in a jungle far to the south that was thought to have been extinct. It is so rare that many experts say that it is a myth. %BREAK%Only a few people have seen it worldwide. Apparently, it appears only to those people who are pure of heart and have a strong desire to see it.
My colleagues in Kanto, including my instructor, Professor Oak, spent a long time studying Mew. It looks like our findings match theirs!
According to our research, Mew was said to be observed using moves of all kinds. This observation has led some of us to say that Mew is the ancestor of all Pokémon!
Perhaps by studying Pokémon in battle, we’ll learn more!
Please perform the following research tasks.{0}{1}{2}
Great work, %PLAYERNAME%! This will help point us in the right direction.
Did you know Mew is said to hold the genetic codes of all Pokémon? Mew’s secrets could be a link to understanding the mystery of Pokémon growth and Evolution!
Let's study some Pokémon Evolution to learn more about Mew!
Please perform these research tasks for me.{0}{1}{2}
Amazing. Just amazing! Isn’t Evolution wondrous? I learn something new every time I see it!
With the data we’ve collected so far, I should be able to pinpoint Mew’s location! It looks like...
Yes, it looks like Mew has visited your area recently! Hmm... Interesting. If that's the case, someone should have reported a sighting...
Maybe Mew is hiding or disguised as another Pokémon? Let's study some other Pokémon that use these tricks and the best ways to catch them!
Please perform the following research tasks.{0}{1}{2}
Thank you, %PLAYERNAME%! With your help, I’ve determined that Mew is invisible!
Let's collect some data to build a tool to find it. I have an idea... I’ll need you to study some powerful Pokémon up close to help me out!
Could you complete the following research tasks?{0}{1}{2}
Nice! My prototype is functioning well. I’ve upgraded your AR camera with the new ability to see invisible Pokémon!
The final step is to lure out Mew. Mew is said only to appear to those who are pure of heart and have a strong desire to meet it...
Let’s show Mew what a great Trainer you are and how excited we are to see it!
Please carry out the following research tasks.{0}{1}{2}
We found Mew! Awesome! This is an experience to remember forever.
Now you can see why I love studying Pokémon so much! The whole world is out there to discover. So go have some fun!
My assistants and I will request some Special Research from you in the future. Stay in touch!
Hello, %PLAYERNAME%! You’ve caught me at a curious time. You see, I was just out for a walk, thinking about how much I’d love to see a Mudkip, when—wouldn’t you know it—I came across a whole mess of them!
Did you know that Mudkip sleep by burying themselves in soil at the water’s edge? Sounds adorable, right?
One of the many things that’s always impressed me about Mudkip is how strong it is in spite of its size.
When faced with a tight situation in battle, Mudkip will unleash its amazing power. It can even crush rocks much bigger than itself!
It would be less than ideal if all these Mudkip were to do that right now... And yet, the researcher in me is curious to see it happen! Haha!
Anyway, what do you say we do a bit of research on Mudkip, %PLAYERNAME%?
Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%. I see you’ve brought a Mudkip with you—nice work!
Using the fin on its head, Mudkip senses the flow of water to keep track of what’s going on around it.
I got a bit too close during my observations earlier, and those Mudkip splashed mud all over my coat! Which actually got me thinking about Mudkip’s Evolution, Marshtomp.
Living on muddy ground that provides poor footing has made Marshtomp’s legs sturdy.
And because it’s used to such slippery surfaces, Marshtomp can quickly overwhelm foes mired in mud.
While I clean my coat off, why don’t you try evolving your Mudkip so you can see Marshtomp firsthand, %PLAYERNAME%?
I knew I should’ve brought an extra coat with me... Ah! Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%. That’s a very sturdy-looking Marshtomp you have with you.
Don’t you think it’s inspiring how Pokémon thrive in all sorts of environments? Mudkip and Marshtomp seem like an especially versatile bunch.
Now, I have some exciting news. I caught a glimpse of some Swampert—Marshtomp’s Evolution—while you were away!
Swampert can not only break boulders into pieces with one swing of its arms, but it can also predict storms by sensing subtle differences in the sounds of waves and tidal winds with its fins!
I tend to get so engrossed in my research that I lose track of my surroundings, so having a Swampert around might be just what I need.
...What’s that? I could just try to pay a bit more attention myself? Well, I suppose that’s an option... But not quite as fun, don’t you think? Haha!
Why don’t you try evolving your Marshtomp, %PLAYERNAME%?
Wow, %PLAYERNAME%! It’s hard to believe that Swampert of yours was once a tiny, adorable Mudkip. Pokémon really are incredible!
Swampert tend to make nests near beautiful beaches, and it’s strong enough to tow a large ship.
I guess you know which Pokémon to bring with you on your next beach vacation, eh?
You know, the last time I saw Mudkip appearing en masse like they are today, I also saw all manner of Trainers out exploring and researching, too.
It always fills me with joy to see everyone having fun with Pokémon. I hope you’ve enjoyed yourself today as well!
As for me, I think it’s time I stomp on home. I’ll be in touch!
Hmm... It’s not like they sprouted legs and walked off, so what could have—
Oh, %PLAYERNAME%! Sorry, I didn’t notice you there. I’m trying to figure out where my Pinap Berries went. Maybe you could help me figure it out!
You see, Pinap Berries have been particularly abundant around here as of late. I’ve never seen so many growing at once!
It’s like the soil’s been filled with nature’s energy.
Pinap fan that I am, I picked a basketful to juice and set it down right over there, but I got distracted reading this paper on regional differences in Slowpoke.
And when I turned around, the whole basket was empty!
I suppose now I have a wonderful excuse to go for a stroll and gather more...but all the same, I’m curious why they vanished in the first place.
While I pick more Berries, %PLAYERNAME%, can you poke around and see if any Pokémon in the area might be responsible?
%PLAYERNAME%! Welcome ba—whoa there!
Excuse my sudden wobbling. I take it you’ve found yourself some Noibat! Their enormous ears can emit ultrasonic waves of 200,000 hertz.
For the record, even a robust wrestler will become dizzy and unable to stand when exposed to Noibat’s ultrasonic waves!
At any rate, I think you’ve found our culprit, since fruits are its favorite foods. That must be why they swiped my Pinap Berries! Well, I’m always more than happy to share with Pokémon.
But there’s a silver lining to finding our Berry bandit—now we’ve got the perfect Pokémon to research today.
See if you can attract more Noibat with Pinap Berries, %PLAYERNAME%!
Well done, %PLAYERNAME%! Those Noibat sure look happy.
I suppose Noibat and I share an appreciation for Pinap Berries, huh? And it’s no phase, I assure you—Noibat’s love of fruit persists even after evolving into Noivern.
Although Noivern have a violent disposition, if you give them a nice ripe fruit that they love, they will suddenly become tame.
Y’know, there’s an idea—why not help your Noibat evolve into Noivern, %PLAYERNAME%?
I reckon the Pinap Berries you fed them will keep that temper of theirs at bay!
Excellent work, %PLAYERNAME%! I must say, your Noivern looks pretty chipper.
My research says that this Pokémon is often aggressive and will ruthlessly torment enemies that are helpless in the dark. Yikes!
Luckily for us, your Noivern looks quite fond of you! I’m sure you’ll continue to be great friends, even if you don’t have its beloved fruits on hand.
Thanks for spending the day learning with me. It’s always fun when we find something we have in common with Pokémon, don’t you think?
Of course, I’m talking about a love of Berries—not sharing a cruel disposition!
I hope you’d agree with that, right, %PLAYERNAME%?...Right?
Hi there! It’s so nice to meet you, %PLAYERNAME%. My name is Professor Willow. I’m a Pokémon researcher, and I’ll be guiding you on your journey—and what a journey it shall be!
You’ll also be helping me with my research along the way. So really, we’re more like colleagues!
First things first—let’s go over how to catch Pokémon, make a Curveball Throw, and transfer Pokémon.
You can catch Pokémon with Poké Balls.
If you throw a Poké Ball at the center of the Pokémon and time your throw just right, you can even achieve a Nice, Great, or Excellent Throw!
Curveball Throws are advanced throws that can help you grow even more as a Trainer. To make a Curveball Throw, spin the Poké Ball as you throw it.
It’s OK if you don’t get it at first. That’s what practice is for!
Once you’ve caught some Pokémon, you can keep them in your Pokémon storage or transfer them to my mobile lab in exchange for Candy.
I’ll explain more about Candy later. For now, how about you go catch some Pokémon?
Hello again, %PLAYERNAME%! How was catching Pokémon? Not too bad after the first few tries, right?
Soon, you’ll be making Excellent Curveball Throws as easily as a Goldeen swims in water!
Next, I’d like to talk to you about an item that I’ve created called Incense.
It emits a fragrance that is irresistible to Pokémon, making them come to you, instead of having you go to them! Handy, eh?
If you know you’re going to be out adventuring for a while, using Incense can really boost the amount of Pokémon you encounter. It’s one of my favorite items.
Speaking of items, have you heard of Berries? There are several different types that Pokémon enjoy eating, and they each have different effects.
For example, Nanab Berries calm Pokémon down, making it easier for you to aim a Poké Ball at them.
How about you give these items a try? Go ahead and use an Incense to attract Pokémon. Then, use Nanab Berries to help you catch them!
Hello again, %PLAYERNAME%! Great work using Incense and Berries to help you catch Pokémon.
If you’re ever running low on Berries or Poké Balls, you can visit PokéStops to get more.
Spinning the Photo Disc at a PokéStop can grant you those items as well as other goodies. You can also get Field Research tasks by doing so, which you can complete to encounter Pokémon or receive items.
PokéStops are usually located at interesting places, like a monument, a public park, or a local café.
They encourage Trainers to explore the world around them. Isn’t that exciting?
Why don’t you go do some exploring? Who knows—you might discover some interesting places!
Welcome back, Trainer! I just returned from a stroll myself. One thing I love about Field Research is how it always manages to take me to new and exciting locations.
I hope you get to learn a bit more about the world around you as you seek out different PokéStops!
And as fun as that will be, it’ll be even more fun if you bring along a Buddy Pokémon.
Building strong relationships with your Pokémon is pivotal to being a good Trainer—and choosing a Pokémon to be your buddy is a great way to do just that!
You can choose any Pokémon to be your Buddy Pokémon. It can even walk alongside you while you’re out exploring!
To get your buddy to join you on your adventures, give it some treats, such as Berries.
You can boost your friendship with your Buddy Pokémon even further by playing with it, taking photos of it, and battling with it.
Eventually, your Buddy Pokémon can even become your Best Buddy and gain a Best Buddy ribbon! You’ll also earn additional Candy when you walk around with it.
We’ll cover the importance of Candy later, but for now, how about you pick out a Buddy Pokémon and spend some time with it?
Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! Wow, your Buddy Pokémon’s looking pretty pleased! Seeing your bond grow stronger warms my heart.
Keep taking care of your Pokémon to make your relationship flourish!
I see you’ve earned some Candy while exploring with your buddy, too. It’s now time to learn how you can get more Candy, as well as what you can use it for.
You can earn Candy by catching, transferring, and adventuring with Pokémon. You can then use that Candy to power up and evolve your Pokémon!
You’ll also need Stardust, which you can earn by catching Pokémon, hatching Eggs, completing research, and opening Gifts.
Evolving Pokémon helps you fill out your Pokédex and learn all about your Pokémon’s potential. There are even some Pokémon that evolve in unique ways.
Be sure to check the Pokémon in your Pokémon storage to learn more about how to evolve them. You’ll also be able to power up your Pokémon there.
If you need help figuring out which Pokémon to power up and evolve, you can ask your team leader to appraise your Pokémon.
You should have some Candy and Stardust from completing previous research tasks. How about you use them to evolve and power up some Pokémon?
Incredible work, %PLAYERNAME%! Your Pokémon look stronger than ever. Did you learn anything new while evolving and powering up your Pokémon?
When I see a Pokémon discover new possibilities within itself, it makes me feel like I’m capable of anything, too!
But as exciting as that all is, there’s just as much to learn about Pokémon in some of their earliest forms, too.
Next, we’re going to discuss Eggs and Pokémon that can hatch from them.
You can get 2 km, 5 km, and 10 km Eggs by spinning PokéStops, and you can get 7 km Eggs by opening Gifts from your friends.
To hatch these Eggs, you’ll need to place them in an Incubator and travel the indicated distance.
If you want to hatch Eggs even faster, Super Incubators decrease the distance required to hatch Eggs. Be sure to use these Incubators wisely.
You’ll be able to get Eggs in other ways, too.
For example, you can get Strange Eggs by defeating Team GO Rocket Leaders. As you go on your Trainer journey, you’ll have opportunities to take on Team GO Rocket and obtain these Eggs.
You should have a handful of Eggs already. How about you get to hatching some?
Look at all the Eggs you’ve hatched, %PLAYERNAME%! What an accomplishment.
Being a dedicated Trainer takes quite a bit of work, wouldn’t you say? Even so, you can’t forget to have fun along the way.
You’ll see in your Item Bag that you have a camera. You can use this camera to take snapshots of your Pokémon and commemorate all sorts of moments and memories.
You can take a snapshot when encountering wild Pokémon, when viewing your Pokémon in your Pokémon storage, and when interacting with your buddy.
How about you give it a shot? A...snapshot, that is. Haha!
%PLAYERNAME%, I’ve been looking through the photos you took, and I have to say, I’m quite impressed!
Have you considered moonlighting as a Pokémon photographer? You certainly have the chops for it!
An important part of battling effectively is using attacks that are super effective against the Pokémon defending the Gym.
Different Pokémon and their attacks have different types, and those types have weaknesses to other types. For example, Fire-type Pokémon are weak against Water-type attacks.
I’d like for you to try using supereffective attacks when battling at a Gym. Try using Charged Attacks of different types to see which ones work best.
Let’s see what you’re made of, %PLAYERNAME%! Get out there and battle in some Gyms.
Do you recognize these structures? I’m sure you’ve come across them in your photographic forays.
They’re called Gyms, and they’ll prove to be quite important in your Trainer journey.
Gyms are always one of four colors, depending on which team controls them.
Red Gyms are controlled by Team Valor, led by the headstrong Candela. Blue Gyms are controlled by Team Mystic, headed up by the analytical Blanche.
Yellow Gyms are controlled by Team Instinct, whose proud leader is the incomparable Spark. He’s known for following his gut.
Gray Gyms are neutral, meaning that no team controls them.
If a Gym is controlled by your team, you can assign a Pokémon to defend it. Gyms can have up to six Pokémon defending them at a time.
If a Gym is controlled by another team, you can battle to try to claim it. Find a Gym that’s controlled by a different team, and give battling a shot!
How was your Gym experience, %PLAYERNAME%? A unique kind of workout, isn’t it? Haha!
Anyhoo, did you notice that at some Gyms, you were faced with a single Pokémon instead of Gym defenders?
Those Pokémon are called Raid Bosses, and you can challenge them in Raid Battles!
In Raid Battles, you can battle alongside friends and other Trainers to challenge a Raid Boss.
These Pokémon are formidable foes, indeed. Sometimes, you can find certain Pokémon only as Raid Bosses.
Before entering a Raid Battle, make sure to power up your Pokémon! Stocking up on lots of Candy and Stardust will allow you to bring powerful teams to Raid Battles.
Power up some Pokémon, then try taking on a raid. If you don’t succeed, you can team up with other Trainers.
You’ll never know what you’re capable of until you try, right?
Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! I’m hoping you can help me with something. You see, I was out for a walk recently and noticed several trees covered in slash marks—and I think I know what made them.
There’s a Pokémon called Oshawott—the Sea Otter Pokémon—that keeps a scalchop on its stomach that it can detach and use as a blade. I’ve seen a lot of Oshawott around lately, so I’m thinking they may be our mystery tree carvers.
Could you catch some Oshawott so we can learn more about them?
Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! Did you know that Oshawott uses the scalchop on its stomach not only to fight but also to break open hard berries? Gotta love a good multitool.
Now that we’ve learned more about Oshawott, I was hoping we could turn our attention to its Evolution, Dewott. Don’t let its cute appearance fool you—Dewott takes itself very seriously.
Also known as the Discipline Pokémon, Dewott uses strict training to learn its flowing double-scalchop technique. I’d love to see Dewott’s fighting in action! Can you evolve your Oshawott for me, Trainer?
Wow, Dewott’s double-scalchop technique is incredible! Pokémon truly never cease to amaze, eh, %PLAYERNAME%?
I barely have the coordination to rub my tummy and pat my head at the same time, and here we have Pokémon mastering bespoke battle techniques. It’s inspiring stuff!
I think I’ve gained a better understanding of Dewott—which means we can begin studying its Evolution.
Dewott’s Evolution, Samurott, is known to wield swords called seamitars incorporated in its armor. Apparently, Samurott can draw and sheathe its seamitars in the time it takes a foe to blink.
Not hard to see why it’s known as the Formidable Pokémon! Why don’t you evolve Dewott so we can witness Samurott’s majesty for ourselves?
Excellent work, Trainer! That’s a fine Samurott. Its seamitars truly are a sight to behold! Knowing how quickly it can draw and sheathe its blades, I wonder how fast it can dice up berries...
Thanks for all your help today, %PLAYERNAME%. We’ve learned so much about Oshawott, Dewott, and Samurott—and from them, too! I’ll “sea” you next time! Haha!
Oh, %PLAYERNAME%! Great to see you.
Your timing is impeccable. Because you know what? I’ve had enough!
That’s right—I’ve had enough of waiting to see a guardian deity. Everyone but me has managed to glimpse one out of pure serendipity, so I’ve decided to be proactive and embark on a search for Tapu Fini!
Do you think you could lend me a hand? With you involved, I think my chance of success will skyrocket.
Tapu Fini is the guardian deity of Poni Island in the Alola region.
Terrible calamities sometimes befall those who recklessly approach Tapu Fini, so I’m going to think very carefully about how we can successfully—and safely—track it down.
In the meantime, can you see what Team GO Rocket is up to? I’d like to avoid any complications in our search.
Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%!
I’ve been busy researching Tapu Fini. My sources say that it can manipulate water, and it lives deep within a thick fog.
With that in mind, I’d hazard a guess that we’ll have the most luck uncovering Tapu Fini’s whereabouts if we look in places where other Water-type Pokémon are appearing.
I’ll start by visiting every foggy lake I can find. I can hear Blanche’s water safety spiel already...
But, personally speaking, a bit of risk is worth it if I finally get to see an island guardian with my own eyes! You remember to be careful, too, okay?
Now, let’s get back out there!
%PLAYERNAME%! Can you believe it?!
I was knee-deep in the last lake I thought to check—shoes soggy, Dewpider on all sides—when I finally, FINALLY, saw Tapu Fini!
I’d love to tell you more about it, but I need to scribble down all the details in my journal while they’re fresh in my mind.
You should head out and see if you can catch a glimpse of Tapu Fini yourself!
Phew! Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%. How’d you fare?
You saw Tapu Fini as well?! That’s fantastic!
Now you’ve seen all four of Alola’s guardian deities. And I’ve seen...all of one.
That’s... Well, it’s one more than I’d seen before, isn’t it!
Just have to stay positive. No use feeling jealous of others’ good fortune...
Now that we know all the island guardians are nearby, we should look into why they’ve appeared here.
Were the cause some unsavory act on our part, I think they would have confronted us directly by now—but instead, we’ve been the ones tracking them down.
It’s certainly possible their motives have nothing to do with us. Though I have to assume they’re investigating the area for a reason.
But what could that reason be? I suppose all we can do for now is wait and see what happens.
Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! It’s great to see you again! I’m always grateful to have a helping hand with my research.
Speaking of research, have you heard of Porygon, the Virtual Pokémon?
Well, I’m not entirely sure why, but Porygon have been appearing more frequently in the area as of late!
I’d like to take this opportunity to learn more about this odd Pokémon. How about it, Trainer? Will you go out and catch some Porygon for me?
Fantastic work, %PLAYERNAME%!
I was able to review the data you collected, and I discovered that Porygon is made entirely of programming code!
Other reports I dug up mention that it was created by a group of scientists using state-of-the-art technology. Can you believe it? A man-made Pokémon!
Porygon have made a name for themselves by protecting cyberspace from suspicious activity! For something artificial, they sure do seem caring.
Maybe I should keep a Porygon around in case Team GO Rocket tries a digital take-over...
Well, in the meantime, I’d like to learn more about Porygon’s evolved form, Porygon2.
I have a hunch that you’ll need to use an Upgrade to evolve Porygon. Let's get back out there and see if we can't find one!
Excellent work, %PLAYERNAME%!
Thanks to your efforts, I’ve realized just how different Porygon2 is from Porygon.
According to my findings, further research and the implementation of artificial intelligence into its code allowed Porygon2 to develop the ability to learn independent of its programming.
The power of science is just astounding, isn’t it?
These reports also mention that Porygon2 was upgraded to enable extraterrestrial exploration and planetary development, though it has yet to accomplish much.
I wonder what this means for Porygon’s final Evolution, Porygon-Z?
For your next batch of research, I want you to evolve Porygon2 into Porygon-Z using a Sinnoh Stone. Good luck out there, Trainer!
Congrats on evolving your Porygon2 into a Porygon-Z, %PLAYERNAME%!
I’ve uncovered some notes about this Pokémon that I thought you’d find interesting.
According to reports, an update was added to Porygon-Z’s programming that was supposed to allow it to move between dimensions. But the upgrade also caused Porygon-Z to become unstable, and it began behaving erratically.
Because the update caused instability, academics can’t seem to agree on whether Porygon-Z should be considered a true Evolution of Porygon2.
It’s going to take a bit of time to file away all this research, but I’m thrilled we were able to learn more about Porygon and its Evolutions!
Your hard work is always appreciated, %PLAYERNAME%, and I’ll be in touch as soon as I’m in need of another inquisitive eye!
Until then, let’s GO!
%PLAYERNAME%, you’re not going to believe this!
Have you seen those Poké Ball–like Pokémon rolling about?
This all begs the question: why are Hisuian Voltorb appearing now after being absent for so long? Did they somehow travel to the present from the Sinnoh region of the past?
I have a theory that when Team GO Rocket broke open the mysterious door, it somehow caused these Hisuian Voltorb to appear in our time.
Now why am I suddenly reminded of Celebi, the Time Travel Pokémon...
Anyway, that’s all I’ve got! Kind of unbelievable, isn’t it?
I’m going to do some more digging on my end, and I’d love your help researching these bygone Pokémon out in the field!
Let’s investigate Hisuian Voltorb together.
They look an awful lot like Voltorb—a Pokémon native to the Kanto region, among others—but I’ve never seen any Voltorb quite like these.
I reached out to everyone I could think of and pored over all the research documents I could get my hands on, but get this: nothing in modern scholarship mentions this Pokémon!
However, I did eventually find something. Did you know that the Sinnoh region used to be known as the Hisui region?
Well, I found historical documentation of an old-fashioned Poké Ball developed long ago in the Hisui region, and I realized it greatly resembles this mysterious Pokémon. Or could it be the other way around?
Which came first: the Poké Ball or the Pokémon? Who knows!
Taking all this into consideration, I believe this anomalous Pokémon is, in fact, a Voltorb that once lived in the Hisui region.
Is it still a regional variant if it only existed in the past? Gosh, what a puzzle.
For now, I suppose we may as well call this Pokémon Hisuian Voltorb.
I’m still reeling, %PLAYERNAME%.
Can you believe Pokémon from a different time are now appearing around us?
Anyway. Our research sure has been exciting lately, hasn’t it, %PLAYERNAME%?
Something tells me we’re in for even more exciting discoveries!
Let’s keep at it and see what else our adventure together brings.
I wonder what this Pokémon has seen in the Hisui region—and what it thinks of the future it’s suddenly seeing now!
Ah, the Hisui region... I wonder what other kinds of Pokémon lived there.
What I wouldn’t give to go back in time and experience the Hisui region for myself! It’d be a dream come true!
Maybe if I ever meet Celebi, I could ask it for a quick trip back in time, just to sate my curiosity!
...But I’m sure that’s not possible. It’s nice to dream, though!
Anyway, I’ve decided to research whether Hisuian Voltorb can evolve.
I haven’t the foggiest if it can, but that won’t stop me. I want to learn everything about this strange and wonderful Pokémon.
After all, it’s not every day that a literal blast from the past falls into your lap! Get it? Because Voltorb can Self-Destruct? Haha...
Hi, %PLAYERNAME%, I’m glad to see you! Can I get your help with investigating something?
I’ve noticed an alarming number of reports from Trainers who have found PokéStops that look...discolored?
Some Trainers have even spotted people wearing shirts with a big letter R on them who are guarding these PokéStops.
These shady characters appear to have Pokémon with a mysterious dark aura around them!
As I investigate this with Spark, it might be best to power up some of your Pokémon. You never know what we might encounter...
Great job strengthening your Pokémon!
After visiting one of the PokéStops with Spark, we were challenged to a Trainer Battle by someone who belongs to an organization called Team GO Rocket!
Turns out that Team GO Rocket has been stealing resources from PokéStops with the help of Pokémon that are cloaked in a dark aura. They’re called Shadow Pokémon!
Luckily, we won the battle, and afterward, Team GO Rocket carelessly abandoned their defeated Shadow Pokémon!
Help us protect local PokéStops from Team GO Rocket, Trainer! As you do so, please save any Shadow Pokémon that Team GO Rocket abandons!
Thanks for all your hard work, %PLAYERNAME%! Candela and I have done some research on Shadow Pokémon and learned some very unsettling things.
While Pokémon naturally become stronger through training, these Shadow Pokémon seem to have been overpowered through unnatural means.
As a result, their bodies painfully struggle with not knowing how to control this strength.
But don’t worry! It looks like we can help them harness this strength through a process called purification.
Can you help me purify some Shadow Pokémon, %PLAYERNAME%?
WOW! Thanks for helping us learn more about the Shadow Pokémon that Team GO Rocket uses, Trainer!
After observing the purification process with Blanche, it’s clear that the Pokémon’s gratefulness to you for purifying them causes the move Frustration to be replaced with Return!
Now that you have this knowledge, we need your help with saving as many Shadow Pokémon as possible by taking back PokéStops that are under Team GO Rocket’s control!
The world is under attack! Can we count on you to help protect it? I do hope there’s nothing more to this...
%PLAYERNAME%! How have you been? Finding time to relax, I hope? Perhaps with your Pokémon?
I’m enjoying a bit of a productivity boom, myself, but it’s made me realize that my research has gone uninterrupted for quite some time.
I fear there may be trouble brewing—specifically from Team GO Rocket. They’ve been too quiet for too long, don’t you think?
Would you mind patrolling the area to see if anything’s amiss?
Well done, %PLAYERNAME%. As much as I wish they’d give us a break, I know Team GO Rocket never rests—so neither can we!
I’m relieved to see you’ve rescued a couple of Shadow Pokémon from them already.
As both a professor and as someone who loves Pokémon, I can’t stand idly by as Team GO Rocket mistreats so many innocent Pokémon.
Let’s get back out there and rescue some more Pokémon from them!
Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! Thanks for handling those Team GO Rocket Grunts. You and your Pokémon have done a great job of scaring them off, as usual!
They’ll think twice before showing up around here again, I suspect.
But those Shadow Pokémon they’ve left behind... Well, at least they’re safe with us now.
%PLAYERNAME%, let’s purify them so they can put their terrible time with Team GO Rocket in the past. I know they’ll be grateful for your help!
Those Pokémon are looking much better now, %PLAYERNAME%. I’m sure they’re relieved to be with a Trainer like you and away from Team GO Rocket.
Now that we’ve cleared out some of their underlings, I think we’d better track down the Team GO Rocket Leaders.
Based on how you handled those Grunts, I’m sure the Leaders won’t stand a chance!
You’ve done it, %PLAYERNAME%! Once again, you’ve been instrumental in stopping Team GO Rocket from getting their way.
It’s a privilege to watch you and your partners grow together and use your strength to help Pokémon everywhere.
Now. We’ve neutralized the Team GO Rocket Leaders, so it’s time to let Giovanni know that we’re not going to let him carry out his plan unchallenged.
I know he’s tough—but you’re tougher. I have the utmost confidence in you, %PLAYERNAME%!
Incredible work, %PLAYERNAME%! You and your Pokémon have an impressive bond—one that Team GO Rocket will never be able match.
Pokémon everywhere are fortunate to have you on their side!
I know it won’t be long before Team GO Rocket appears with another scheme, but I can rest a bit easier knowing that you’re here to stop them right in their tracks.
For now, though, get some rest. You’ve more than earned it!
Greetings, Pokémon Trainer.
There appears to be an increased number of Team GO Rocket members in the area.
I have yet to determine what they are doing here, but I suspect that a scheme of some sort is underway.
We should investigate before they decide to cause trouble.
Thank you, Pokémon Trainer. The atmosphere is improved with fewer Team GO Rocket members present.
One detail still mystifies me. Why do the Pokémon used by Team GO Rocket possess those peculiar auras?
I see. They become Shadow Pokémon through experimentation and mistreatment.
So they corrupt a blameless creature, and then they abandon it?
Their cruelty is unforgiveable.
I am coming to realize that this group will pursue their goals relentlessly and without conscience.
We must impede them however we can.
Come, Pokémon Trainer—let us begin by rescuing some Shadow Pokémon.
Those poor Pokémon...
... ... ...
Ah—Pokémon Trainer.
Apologies for my dour demeanor. I cannot stop thinking about the Shadow Pokémon.
Is there nothing we can do beyond rescuing them from Team GO Rocket? Will they remain in this state forever?
Hm? You are able to...purify them?
If doing so removes their ominous aura, I would like nothing more than to observe this phenomenon.
Will you show me, Pokémon Trainer?
So this is a Purified Pokémon. Its shadowy aura is gone. In its place—radiance.
You are deserving of praise, Pokémon Trainer. But our efforts cannot end here. 
Perhaps we should turn our attention to Team GO Rocket members of a higher standing.
If you can defeat their leaders in battle, we may hinder their plans.
Those battles were among the fiercest I have witnessed, Pokémon Trainer. I am fortunate to call you my ally.
Regrettably, it seems the Team GO Rocket leaders were not inspired to change their ways. They, too, have abandoned their Shadow Pokémon.
But surely we have at least stalled their plans. Such an expansive organization cannot function without its leaders at full strength.
Hm? We must still deal with this...Giovanni, is it? I see.
Then our work is not yet finished, Pokémon Trainer.
That was a fearsome battle, Pokémon Trainer.
I am dazzled by your capacity to overcome any challenge set before you.
Please, relish your well-earned victory—but we must remain vigilant. If Team GO Rocket were to manipulate the Ultra Beasts...
We do not want their villainy to interfere with our endeavors.
For now, however, I think we can turn our attention back to the Ultra Wormholes.
So long as they remain open in your world, more Ultra Beasts could appear.
Though considering the strength you displayed today, perhaps my fear is unnecessary.
In any case, thank you for allowing me to observe you today. I am pleased we were able to assist so many Pokémon.
Until again, Pokémon Trainer.
%PLAYERNAME%. I suspect you have already noticed, but Team GO Rocket seems to be assembling en masse again.
What shadowy schemes could those ruffians be plotting? They look to be glowering right at you.
Surely they couldn’t be thinking of absconding with the Ultra Beasts?
Or perhaps they’ve designs on Cosmoem. In its current state, I fear—
No. Anxious speculation will not avail us. Preventative measures must come first.
%PLAYERNAME%. Could you use your battling skills to send some of these Grunts away?
Huh. I thought there were more Team GO Rocket Grunts around earlier...
Oh, %PLAYERNAME%, it’s you! I guess I’ve got you to thank for getting those goons out of here.
Rhi says they may be taking an interest in our otherworldly visitors, huh?
I’m inclined to think they’re right. Good thing you’re here to save the day!
Keep flushing Team GO Rocket out, %PLAYERNAME%. Try looking for their Leaders next.
I’m sure you and Rhi can track them down!
Brilliant work, %PLAYERNAME%. You’ve managed to defeat Team GO Rocket’s Leaders.
I knew your superlative skills would lead you to victory. And you had the chance to speak with Professor Willow, correct? What did he have to say?
I see... Though I am pleased Professor Willow has corroborated my theory, I continue to be concerned for the Ultra Beasts and Cosmoem.
I take solace in knowing that we have dispersed the majority of Team GO Rocket, if nothing else.
Now, the time has come to challenge the man who sits atop the organization: Giovanni.
So, you sent Giovanni home with his tail between his legs? Just another day in the life for you, huh, %PLAYERNAME%?
It’s no easy feat to put Team GO Rocket back in their place, but you rose to the challenge.
Great job! Now take some well-deserved rest with your Pokémon.
I’ll be in touch again soon!
Hello, %PLAYERNAME%. You know, it was shaping up to be a beautiful day, but then I noticed there are more Team GO Rocket Grunts than usual lurking about.
Do you think they’re up to something? Could it be connected to all the Electric-type Pokémon that’ve been around recently?
I have heard that Team GO Rocket has a reputation for causing trouble at power plants... Hm.
Would you do me a favor and investigate what’s going on, %PLAYERNAME%? Just to be safe.
Great work dealing with those Team GO Rocket Grunts, %PLAYERNAME%. They’ll think twice before trying to battle you again!
If only they’d spare as much thought for the Shadow Pokémon they’ve abandoned in their wake.
I hope that one day, we’ll put a stop Team GO Rocket’s mistreatment of Pokémon once and for all.
But until then, at least we can do something for the Pokémon they leave behind.
Let’s purify some Shadow Pokémon.
Welcome back! Those Pokémon you purified are looking better already, %PLAYERNAME%.
Thanks for helping them—and me. It’s a relief to see them safe with you.
They’ll shine even brighter the longer they spend with you, I’m sure.
But back to business. Next, look for Cliff, Sierra, and Arlo. We can’t let...whatever they’re doing proceed unchecked! Or untested for nefariousness, at least.
Great job, %PLAYERNAME%! You’ve made quick work of the Team GO Rocket Leaders.
*sigh* I wish they’d change their ways. I have to give them credit—they’ve got a wealth of knowledge on Pokémon, and they’re strong Trainers to boot.
Imagine what we could learn together if they used that passion for good...
I know, I know. That’s “highly improbable,” as Rhi might say. No harm in wishing, though!
Now, I have one final request. I’d like you to track down the one person I’m sure will never change: Giovanni, the head of Team GO Rocket!
Expertly handled, %PLAYERNAME%! I knew Giovanni didn’t stand a chance against you.
You’re getting to be a real pro at battling him. No matter what he throws at you, there’s just no beating the bond between you and your Pokémon.
I think it’s time you took a rest and celebrated your victory with the Pokémon you’ve freed from Team GO Rocket’s clutches.
Let’s hope they learn their lesson one day soon.
See you later, %PLAYERNAME%!
Thanks for your help in defeating Team GO Rocket Grunts, %PLAYERNAME%!
The team leaders and I have been observing Team GO Rocket, and something tells us this is far from over.
The transmission sent during the Team GO Rocket take-over had a message from an unknown sender at the end.
We’re going to need all the help we can get to reveal the identity of this unknown figure looming in the shadows, and you are just the Trainer for the job!
Can you help us get to the bottom of this mystery?
Thank you for your continued support against those pesky Team GO Rocket Grunts.
As they flee, some Grunts are leaving behind Mysterious Components.
I believe these are what Team GO Rocket is using to hack and steal resources from PokéStops. Clever little devices, aren’t they?
There’s information we can glean from these components that will help us in our fight against this dangerous organization.
Once you have enough pieces, you should be able to assemble something similar to the device I’ve modified in my lab. It might be best to prepare yourself for whatever might come, %PLAYERNAME%.
Interesting. It appears there’s more to Team GO Rocket than previously thought.
Their ingenuity has got me thinking there might be another use for these Mysterious Components. We shouldn’t underestimate Team GO Rocket.
It’s time to get battle ready, %PLAYERNAME%.
I don’t want to send you out to face another foe without some more training.
While you sharpen your battle skills, I’ll be sure to get this little project of mine up and operational.
Fantastic work, Trainer. I’ve been working on a prototype for something I call the Rocket Radar, but I was missing some critical components.
Your hard work in retrieving these components actually made my device work!
If we combine my research and these Mysterious Components you’ve found, we can create a radar-like tool to track down Team GO Rocket Hideouts!
Trainers all over the world are figuring out how to put together devices like this, and they’re identifying more hideouts than I originally anticipated.
%PLAYERNAME%, it’s time to head to these hideouts and face whatever—or whomever—is there head on. Let’s GO.
You battled well, %PLAYERNAME%! You’ve done your team leaders—and me—proud.
According to my observations, it appears the sender of that mysterious transmission during the Team GO Rocket take-over was not in attendance.
There’s someone else calling the shots—someone above Sierra, Cliff, and Arlo.
I’ve improved on my previous invention and put together a Super Rocket Radar that should help you track this mastermind down.
If it is who I think it is, he signs all his messages with “G.”
Astounding work, %PLAYERNAME%!
You’ve put a stop to Team GO Rocket’s plans for the time being and rescued a special Shadow Pokémon!
It’s unlikely that Giovanni will give up this easily, so I hope we can rely on you to take down Team GO Rocket members as they appear around your area.
Spark, Blanche, and Candela will be on the lookout as well.
I’m sure Team GO Rocket will try to hatch another villainous plot soon...
Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%. Thanks for your help holding back Team GO Rocket’s forces. It’s good to know I can rely on you.
However, something tells me Team GO Rocket won’t be going away anytime soon, so we’re in it for the long haul.
We need to think long-term about our strategy when it comes to Team GO Rocket.
I want to make sure only the most-prepared Trainers are equipped with Super Rocket Radar devices to track Giovanni.
I know you’re an accomplished Trainer, but let’s make sure your skills are keeping up with the challenge Team GO Rocket poses.
Astounding work, %PLAYERNAME%!
You know how purifying Shadow Pokémon makes them stronger afterward due to the gratitude they feel toward you for saving them?
Maybe one of the Pokémon you purify will become a trusted partner in our efforts to fight against Team GO Rocket’s invasion.
We need to continue saving and purifying these Pokémon.
Remember this: a good Trainer is strong, but a great Trainer is caring and kind.
Fantastic! Good work purifying all those Pokémon, %PLAYERNAME%. They’re practically glowing with gratitude!
It’s easy to tell Shadow and Purified Pokémon apart by the auras that surround them.
One of my favorite sights is a Purified Pokémon standing proud atop a Gym controlled by its Trainer’s team. It’s truly a thing to behold.
It’s time for you and your new friends to train alongside one another.
A difficult challenge awaits you, so you need to be prepared for battle, %PLAYERNAME%.
You should feel proud of your progress, %PLAYERNAME%.
The team leaders and I are certainly proud of how much you’ve grown as a Trainer.
I have one final task for you before I can be sure your skills are keeping up with an opponent like Giovanni.
If you can show me that you can still defeat the Team GO Rocket Leaders...
then I’ll know that you and your Pokémon are in top form.
Your skills are as impressive as ever. It’s time for you to take a Super Rocket Radar and see if you can track down the boss himself.
%PLAYERNAME%, I think you’re ready to take on Giovanni again.
You’ve proven your strength in battle, and you’ve also shown your compassion by saving and purifying Shadow Pokémon.
So get out there and confront Giovanni. With loyal Pokémon at your side and lots of experience under your belt, you’re unstoppable!
Good luck, %PLAYERNAME%!
Fantastic work, %PLAYERNAME%! You should enjoy your victory, of course, but it looks like our work isn’t done.
While you were busy, I was doing some reconnaissance. I have to admit, it’s been quite thrilling!
As you might have guessed, there are many more hideouts and headquarters out there that the Team GO Rocket Leaders and Giovanni could be hiding in.
We may have defeated them for the moment, but I’m sure they’ll be back and causing more trouble soon.
When that day comes, be sure you’re ready for the challenge!
Good to see you again, %PLAYERNAME%.
I’m sure you’ve seen that Team GO Rocket has continued their plans to take over PokéStops and turn even more Pokémon into Shadow Pokémon.
Have you seen an increase in Team GO Rocket activity in your area?
The team leaders and I have been getting reports from Trainers all over the world that these villains haven’t given up.
We need to keep working to save Pokémon from these no-good Grunts and their leaders.
Incredible work, %PLAYERNAME%.
Persistence and determination are key in our continued efforts to take down Team GO Rocket!
Please keep it up.
It’s time to purify more Shadow Pokémon.
They have you to thank for saving them! Perhaps one of the Pokémon you saved will become an essential member of your battle team.
How has your training been going, %PLAYERNAME%?
Be sure to build a healthy habit of improving yourself!
Training isn’t a one-and-done thing.
Becoming a great Trainer is something that comes with continued practice.
It’s important that you’re prepared for the challenges ahead, so let’s GO!
All right! You make the team leaders—and me—proud, %PLAYERNAME%.
It’s time to head out and show those Team GO Rocket Leaders that we’re strong enough to hold our own.
We can’t let these bullies get in our way when we’re saving Pokémon!
Fantastic work. Have you noticed, %PLAYERNAME%?
There seems to be a trend behind which Pokémon Giovanni is turning into Shadow Pokémon. I’m thinking about the fact that he has Legendary Shadow Pokémon.
Could that have anything to do with why he’s here?
In any case, the time has come to track him down.
The more we battle Giovanni and his team of Grunts, the more we learn about why he’s waging these take-overs.
You’ve shown what it takes to be a true Trainer, %PLAYERNAME%.
Your battle with Giovanni wasn’t easy, but the skills you’ve learned through practice and patience have paid off.
Keep your eyes open, Trainer.
Giovanni does not like to lose, so I’m sure he’ll be back soon, trying to further his plans.
I’m sure I can count on you when he returns.
Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%. Thanks for your help battling Team GO Rocket. Trainers like you help keep Pokémon safe!
But this battle is far from over, and we must continue learning about Team GO Rocket, their leaders, and their boss, Giovanni.
Looks like the Rocket Radar I developed is helping the cause. I remember when this strange activity started happening...
Back then, I had a hunch the Mysterious Components that Team GO Rocket Grunts were leaving behind held more secrets than we originally thought. We’ve come quite a long way since then!
On that note, could you continue your work battling Grunts and helping Shadow Pokémon?
Wonderful work, %PLAYERNAME%.
I remember the first time we came across Shadow Pokémon. It was heartbreaking to see the pain they were in, and I knew I had to do something.
As a Pokémon Professor, I always want to contribute and help where I can. I may not be an accomplished battler like you, %PLAYERNAME%, but I can use my skills as a researcher and scientist to assist you on your journey.
That was why I started using Mysterious Components to build the prototype for the Rocket Radar. I hoped that Trainers like you could use it in our ongoing fight against Team GO Rocket and in our efforts to rescue more Pokémon.
So let’s get out there and do just that. I’m grateful for your help, especially now. It’s when times are toughest that we have the greatest opportunity to shine!
Thank you for purifying those Pokémon, %PLAYERNAME%. I’m sure they are just as grateful as I am for your dedication.
Rescuing these Pokémon was the main reason for my work on the Rocket Radar prototype.
Luckily, with the help of the team leaders and motivated Trainers like you, we were able to develop a functioning Rocket Radar and even start work on the Super Rocket Radar!
While a terrible situation, the Team GO Rocket invasion has been a thrilling adventure and research opportunity. I’m anxious but excited to send our findings over to my mentor, Professor Oak. I’ll be sure to let him know you said hello!
Now, it’s time to get back to work. Let’s test your battle skills, %PLAYERNAME%!
I’m always so impressed when Trainers use supereffective moves in battle. It’s a sign of greatness when you see a Trainer using type effectiveness to their advantage.
All our work lately seems to have gotten Team GO Rocket’s attention.
Reports are coming in that Sierra, Cliff, and Arlo are currently lurking in the area. You know what to do, %PLAYERNAME%!
I knew you could do it, %PLAYERNAME%. The more you practice, the better you’ll be able to take on those pesky Team GO Rocket Leaders. I’m sure they’re already scheming up their next plan after this defeat.
But now, Giovanni is waiting.
Using the Super Rocket Radar, track him down and defeat him. We must remain strong—Giovanni is relentless. I wonder why he continues his invasion...
There are so many resources and Pokémon in our world. His evil plans must have something to do with that. My research will continue, but we need you to face him.
Good luck, %PLAYERNAME%. We’re counting on you.
Fantastic work, %PLAYERNAME%!
I will definitely be adding your victory as a note to the research I send over to Professor Oak.
I’m sure he will be interested in anything you’ve learned about Shadow Pokémon and the continuing Team GO Rocket invasion, so please keep up your research and send it my way.
It may seem small, but every little bit helps!
I’ll be in touch soon, since we know Team GO Rocket isn’t likely to go anywhere. I know you’ll be ready for whatever happens next!
Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%. You’ve been instrumental in keeping back Team GO Rocket’s forces.
Thanks to your hard work, we’ve learned so much about this enemy.
Team GO Rocket won’t be going away anytime soon, so I’m glad I can rely on you and your fellow Trainers.
While you’ve done an amazing job so far, I’m looking for more opportunities for you to hone your skills. Every good Trainer needs to stay on their toes!
The Super Rocket Radar is in good hands with you on the task, but I wouldn’t be a good Professor if I didn’t make sure you were keeping up with Giovanni.
As expected, %PLAYERNAME%. Fantastic work!
Even though we’ve been fighting off the threat of Team GO Rocket for some time, I’m still concerned about the fact that Shadow Pokémon keep appearing.
It seems even more Pokémon are being turned into Shadow Pokémon despite our efforts. I’ve been tracking this situation, and the numbers have almost tripled since all this began.
We need to keep pushing forward—those Pokémon need our help! Can I rely on you to purify more Shadow Pokémon?
I’m sure you’ll see them shine with gratitude once you do!
Thank you for your efforts, %PLAYERNAME%.
I’m getting more and more concerned about the growing number of Shadow Pokémon, so we need to keep fighting back against this threat.
Your talent has made it clear that you’re ready for the next step in your preparations.
Use your battle skills to take on some Grunts. I think with some further observation, I can figure out what you need to do to make sure you’re at your best!
All right! You should feel proud of your progress, %PLAYERNAME%. You consistently impress me and the team leaders.
Candela could learn a thing or two from your battle prowess. I’m sure the Team GO Rocket Leaders see you as a challenge.
Take that challenge to them, and drive them out of wherever they’re holed up!
%PLAYERNAME%, your preparations are complete—you’re ready to take on Giovanni.
It’s time for you to use the Super Rocket Radar to track down the boss himself.
You’ve proven not only your strength in battle but also your compassion through saving and purifying Shadow Pokémon.
Confront Giovanni with that strength and compassion, and I believe he won’t be able to stop you!
Good luck, %PLAYERNAME%!
Well done, %PLAYERNAME%. You’ve shown Team GO Rocket just how strong your training has made you.
Although your battle with Giovanni wasn’t easy, the skills you’ve learned through practice and patience have paid off.
But keep your wits about you, %PLAYERNAME%.
Giovanni doesn’t like to lose, so I’m sure he’ll be back soon to further his plans.
I know I can count on you when he returns, but until then, I’ll work on finding some training opportunities for you so you can keep developing your skills.
Great to see you again, %PLAYERNAME%. You’ve done such an amazing job with every challenge I’ve given you.
Congrats on coming so far as a Trainer! You constantly impress me with your skills.
But there are so many aspects to Pokémon training! I think it’s time to switch things up. I spoke with Spark, and he thought it would be good for you to focus some more on taking care of Pokémon Eggs.
Why not take a walk with your buddy Pokémon after placing some Eggs into Incubators?
And be sure to rescue Shadow Pokémon from any Team GO Rocket members you encounter, too. Those Pokémon still need our help!
Wonderful work, %PLAYERNAME%. While you were busy, I met up with Blanche to discuss our research on recent developments with Shadow Pokémon.
I had observed that Team GO Rocket somehow seemed to be making Shadow Pokémon deal more damage with their attacks, though they also seem to take more damage in return now. My observations line up with Blanche’s research.
Both of us are concerned that despite our best efforts to push Team GO Rocket back, they’re still gaining ground and putting more and more Pokémon in danger.
While Blanche and I continue to investigate, can we depend on you to take down some more Grunts to slow Team GO Rocket down?
I’m also going to assign you some tasks to test you as a Trainer. Battling Grunts alone won’t keep your skills as sharp as they need to be to continue standing up to Team GO Rocket’s leaders.
Thanks for taking on those Grunts, %PLAYERNAME%.
I was working with Candela to figure out what challenges we could give you to help you prepare for battles with other Trainers and in the GO Battle League. Those skills carry over to doing battle with the Team GO Rocket Leaders, after all!
Candela was very excited to find ways to keep you on your toes!
Could you take on these challenges as part of your ongoing training?
You’ve done the team leaders proud, %PLAYERNAME%!
You took on those challenges like the skilled Trainer you are.
Great work. Now it’s time to continue the battle against Team GO Rocket.
Your efforts to rescue and purify Shadow Pokémon have certainly not gone unnoticed.
I’ll be sure to share any new findings about Team GO Rocket’s continued invasion as soon as they crop up, but right now, we should keep up the pressure on the Team GO Rocket Leaders. Good luck, %PLAYERNAME%.
Taking on the Team GO Rocket Leaders is no easy task. They have proven to be difficult opponents for even the most accomplished Trainers.
One interesting thing to note is that I’ve heard reports of Trainers rescuing Shiny Shadow Pokémon from the Team GO Rocket Leaders.
This only further supports my suspicions that Team GO Rocket is gathering large numbers of Pokémon if they’ve been able to find Shiny ones to turn into Shadow Pokémon.
There is definitely more that we need to learn about these foes and what their plans are.
For now, I need you to focus. It’s time to take on Giovanni himself. You got this, %PLAYERNAME%.
What an impressive victory, %PLAYERNAME%!
Giovanni is one of the toughest opponents out there, but your continued efforts to improve let you rise to the challenge! After this, I’m going to talk with the team leaders to discuss how we can further support you.
You’ve been an amazing part of the team, and we wouldn’t be able to keep these villains at bay without your skills and dedication.
But we can’t drop our guard while Team GO Rocket’s around, so keep honing your battle techniques. I suggest challenging your fellow Trainers to battles and testing yourself in the GO Battle League.
I’ll be in touch again soon, but until then, let’s GO!
Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! It’s good to see you, though I’m sorry it has to be under such dire circumstances.
What circumstances, you ask? Well, it appears as if Team GO Rocket is—you guessed it—stirring up more trouble!
We’ve just received word that they’re doing something strange at PokéStops.
What exactly they’re doing—and to what end—is what we need to figure out. Let’s get out there and see what we can find!
Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%. It looks like Grunts aren’t involved in whatever new experiments Team GO Rocket is performing.
As you might recall, Grunts use Shadow Pokémon, which are Pokémon that have been trained in unnatural and harmful ways to become incredibly powerful.
We’ve heard rumors that Arlo was the one who spearheaded the Shadow Pokémon program not long after he parted ways with Candela and Team Valor.
More recently, Spark discovered that Team GO Rocket may be hatching a plot involving Pokémon Eggs! Is Arlo involved in this, too?
Let’s investigate more PokéStops and purify some Shadow Pokémon while we’re at it. Something is bound to come up!
Great job saving and purifying those Shadow Pokémon, %PLAYERNAME%!
I noticed you caught a Larvitar. It’s highly unusual to see one in the wild. Maybe it came from one of the Pokémon Eggs that Team GO Rocket has been collecting...
While you were out battling Grunts, the team leaders and I discovered that Team GO Rocket has been collecting a mysterious kind of Pokémon Egg we’re calling Strange Eggs.
It appears that mostly Poison- or Dark-type Pokémon hatch from these Eggs. Let’s save and hatch as many Strange Eggs as possible before Team GO Rocket is able to grow their ranks!
The Team GO Rocket Leaders seem to be guarding these Strange Eggs, so let’s start by finding them. Be sure you have space for Eggs and some Incubators at the ready!
Great job defeating those leaders, %PLAYERNAME%! You’ve saved some pretty cute Pokémon in the process, if I do say so myself.
While you were off fighting Team GO Rocket, Spark and I did some more sleuthing and discovered that Sierra might actually be the brains behind the Strange Eggs!
It appears there’s more to a Team GO Rocket Leader’s duties than just taking over PokéStops and challenging Trainers to battle.
First Arlo with Shadow Pokémon, and now Sierra with these Strange Eggs... I wonder what else Team GO Rocket’s got tucked up their sleeves.
This doesn’t sit well with me, %PLAYERNAME%. Let’s track down those leaders again! We have to do all we can to disrupt their plans!
Incredible work, %PLAYERNAME%! Hopefully that’ll keep them at bay for a little while.
I managed to craft another Super Rocket Radar for you that’ll help you track down Giovanni. But be careful—according to a field report from Blanche and Candela, he’s got Shadow Mewtwo with him!
I managed to build another Super Rocket Radar to help you track down Giovanni. But be careful—Blanche and Candela’s reports revealed that Giovanni has got a Legendary Shadow Pokémon with him!
You might have encountered Shadow Mewtwo the last time Giovanni appeared. We’d thought that was the last we’d see of it, but it looks like it’s back!
You need to save it, Trainer! I have no doubt Giovanni plans on using this poor Pokémon to nefarious ends.
You need to save Shadow Mewtwo, Trainer! I have a feeling Giovanni plans on using this poor Pokémon for nefarious ends.
Celebrations are in order, %PLAYERNAME%. You’ve done it again—you’ve defeated Team GO Rocket’s Grunts, its leaders, and even Giovanni!
Not to mention all the Shadow Pokémon you saved along the way, including Shadow Mewtwo!
Not only did you stop Team GO Rocket, but you also saved several Pokémon along the way!
This is probably not the last that we’ll see of Giovanni or Team GO Rocket, but that also means there’ll likely be more Strange Eggs to collect and Shadow Pokémon to save! Let’s get cracking, Trainer!
Good to see you, %PLAYERNAME%. I’m sorry to call you here so suddenly, but I’m afraid there’s trouble afoot.
That’s right—Team GO Rocket is up to no good! We’re not sure what their plan is just yet, but we know we have to stop them.
Now, let’s GO!
Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%. You did a tremendous job defeating those Team GO Rocket Grunts and saving those poor Shadow Pokémon!
While you were busy battling, I received reports that Team GO Rocket has obtained a Flying-type Legendary Pokémon.
Blanche is doing recon as we speak in hopes of figuring out exactly which Legendary Pokémon we’re dealing with. I have no doubt we’ll have more information soon.
While we wait, why don’t you conduct some research on Flying-type Pokémon?
Thanks for catching all those Flying-type Pokémon, %PLAYERNAME%!
Blanche and I have been analyzing them to help us learn more about the Legendary Pokémon that Team GO Rocket captured.
Unfortunately, our current hypothesis points to this Pokémon being one that’s near and dear to the team leaders’ hearts.
While we gather more information, could you head back out into the field? We can’t let Team GO Rocket continue its plan unopposed!
Welcome back, Trainer. I see you’ve got yourself a Pidgeot and some Pidgeot Mega Energy!
As impressive as this Pokémon is, though, it doesn’t seem to be the Flying-type Pokémon we've heard about in our reports.
Blanche’s latest intel points to Giovanni being the one holding on to this mysterious Flying-type Legendary Pokémon, so we need to track him down.
We believe our best bet at doing so is by first finding the Team GO Rocket Leaders—and that’s where you come in, Trainer. Let’s GO!
Great work, %PLAYERNAME%! You’ve been a huge help in our efforts to track down Giovanni. I’m happy to report that the team leaders and I have made significant headway in our investigation.
I’ve managed to finish building another Super Rocket Radar for you. You can use it to find and defeat Giovanni—and save that Legendary Pokémon!
Fantastic work as always, %PLAYERNAME%!
The fight against Team GO Rocket and their malicious machinations continues, but at least for today we can rest knowing that we’ve foiled their latest scheme.
So, until next time—let’s GO!
Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%. Have you looked up at the sky lately? I thought I’d been staring at reports for too long, but no, there are rainbows everywhere!
That’s not all—I’ve also heard rumors that a mysterious Pokémon has been sighted wherever these rainbows appear. They say rainbows bring good luck, so why not follow one to the end? Haha!
In all seriousness, why don’t you go for a stroll and see for yourself? You never know what we might find!
Keep your eye on the sky, and good luck!
Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%. I’m afraid I have some dire news... It sounds like Team GO Rocket’s gotten wind of these sightings and have set out to catch the mysterious Pokémon for themselves.
Perhaps they're looking for a bit of good luck as well! Haha! Well, whatever their motive, we can’t have them creating more powerful Shadow Pokémon. It’s time to do some investigating.
Knowing how large Team GO Rocket’s forces are, I fear they may have already found it, no doubt leaving Shadow Pokémon in their wake. Let’s go catch some Shadow Pokémon and see where they lead us!
Great job rescuing all those Shadow Pokémon, %PLAYERNAME%! I wish we had time to celebrate, but I just discovered that Team GO Rocket caught up to our mysterious Pokémon...
...and that it’s none other than Ho-Oh, the Rainbow Pokémon! But don’t be discouraged! I truly believe that with enough determination, we can save it, just as we have in the past.
Let’s prep for the gauntlet of battles ahead and gather more information about Ho-Oh’s whereabouts by pursuing more Shadow Pokémon.
Great job saving even more Shadow Pokémon, %PLAYERNAME%! Through your efforts, we’ve learned that Ho-Oh has been handed off to Giovanni and made into a Shadow Pokémon.
For now, I want you to find and defeat Arlo, Cliff, and Sierra! Doing so will help us build a Super Rocket Radar that’ll lead us right to Giovanni...and to Ho-Oh! Good luck!
Incredible work, %PLAYERNAME%! With a Super Rocket Radar in hand, we’ll have no problem finding Giovanni. Defeating him in battle, however, is another story entirely...
Still! Seeing how you were able to beat his underlings, I’m certain you’ll come out on top—and save Ho-Oh to boot!
What a magnificent battle, %PLAYERNAME%! Congrats on defeating Giovanni and saving Ho-Oh from his clutches.
Team GO Rocket never rests, so we should continue to be vigilant. In the meantime, why not get to know your newly saved Ho-Oh?
With the right care and a little luck, any Shadow Pokémon can be purified! I wish you the best, %PLAYERNAME%, and I’ll see you next time!
%PLAYERNAME%! Glad you’re here. There’s something I could use your help with today.
As you know, I’ve been away for a while.
I’ve been thinking about how to shake off the doldrums. Then it hit me like a ton of bricks—Pokémon research! Specifically, I’d like to learn about Roggenrola.
Roggenrola were first discovered a hundred years ago in an earthquake fissure, but the dirt that makes up their bodies is even older!
A Pokémon made of earth is just the thing to get me feeling grounded again, don’t you think? Not that I need an excuse to study Pokémon!
Could you unearth some Roggenrola for me, %PLAYERNAME%?
Great job, %PLAYERNAME%! Let’s get a closer look at those Roggenrola.
Hm... Did you notice the hexagonal cavities on their bodies? Those are their ears, and deep inside is an energy core that makes Roggenrola slightly warm to the touch.
But don’t stick your hand inside the cavity—that’s a surefire way to get on their bad side, and fast!
Is that from firsthand experience, you ask? W-well, any researcher worth his salt has to take the occasional risk.
You know, when Roggenrola evolve into Boldore and their energy is too great to be contained, they grow orange crystals on their bodies hard enough to smash diamonds.
Doesn’t that sound like a sight, %PLAYERNAME%? Why don’t you help Roggenrola evolve so you can see for yourself?
Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! Your Boldore are looking great.
Their crystals—amazing! If only I had some diamonds to put that whole “smashing” thing to the proof.
Well, while we can’t conduct that particular experiment, I can still tell you more about Boldore.
Their crystals are actually masses of energy. Just one crystal fragment could provide enough fuel for a hundred dump trucks!
*sigh* Yet another theory we can’t test ourselves. But if you help Boldore evolve, I’ll tell you all about what they do with that power, %PLAYERNAME%!
There you have it, %PLAYERNAME%—a Gigalith of your own. Those crystals are even bigger now!
When Gigalith’s orange crystals absorb solar energy, it’s magnified internally and fired from its mouth. It’s even capable of blowing away a mountain!
Because of its hefty horsepower, Gigalith is a popular partner for construction workers.
I’m sure you and Gigalith will get along great too, seeing as you’re always out and about.
At any rate, thanks for helping me with my research today, %PLAYERNAME%. I’m feeling more like my old self already.
Let’s do this again soon!
Ahhh... Do you smell that, Trainer?
I first caught a whiff of that curious aroma as I was out on my daily morning walk.
Upon investigation, I discovered that the scent was being produced by an uncommonly large group of Roselia that had assembled nearby.
Did you know you can judge a Roselia’s health by the strength of its aroma? Well, let me tell you—those were VERY healthy Roselia!
But while they certainly smell nice and look pretty, I advise you to take care when encountering them.
The thorns on Roselia’s head contain a vicious poison, and it can launch them at any opponent bold enough to try to steal the flowers on its arms. Every rose, as they say!
It’s unusual to see so many Roselia in one place. Would you mind assisting me in researching this phenomenon?
Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%!
While you were out in the field, I did some reading on Roselia.
When it comes to Pokémon, new discoveries are being made all the time—so it’s important to make sure your information is up to date.
Roselia, the Thorn Pokémon, evolves from Budew, the Bud Pokémon. Budew is sensitive to changes in temperature, and its bud is said to bloom when warmed by the sun.
It’s also both Grass and Poison type, much like Roselia.
In reviewing these two Pokémon, I remembered something tremendously exciting! I still need to conduct a bit more research before sharing my findings, however. Would you mind assisting me?
As aromatic Pokémon go, we’re pretty fortunate it’s Roselia appearing en masse and not, say, Muk.
A big group of Muk gathered under the sun... The whole place would smell like baked garbage!
Oh! Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%. Didn’t realize you were back.
I found that interesting bit of information I wanted to share with you.
According to my research, Roselia that drink nutritionally rich springwater are said to reveal rare coloration when they bloom.
Isn’t that fascinating? Have you seen anything like that while you’ve been out doing research?
You seem to have a lucky streak, so I wouldn’t put it past you!
Now that you’re back, I’d like you to evolve a Roselia with the Sinnoh Stone I gave you.
I’m excited to see the final Evolution in this line of Grass- and Poison-type Pokémon!
Great work, Trainer! Your Roselia has evolved into the Bouquet Pokémon, Roserade!
It moves like a dancer and strikes with whips that are densely lined with poison thorns.
Oh, and have you noticed that each of Roserade’s hands is a different color?
Each contains a different toxin. The poison in its right hand is quick acting, while the poison in its left hand is slow acting.
What an amazing Pokémon!
Thanks for all your assistance today, Trainer. Documenting situations like this is essential to learning more about the Pokémon in the world around us.
Until next time, let’s GO!
Hello, %PLAYERNAME%! It’s great to see you.
It’s been a while, hasn’t it? I’m sure your skills are as sharp as ever, but it couldn’t hurt to do a little warm-up anyway.
Why don’t you start by seeing what Pokémon are in the area?
I can’t wait to see what you find!
%PLAYERNAME%! Back already, eh? Let’s take a look at the Pokémon you caught.
Hmm... Well done! I knew you wouldn’t have any problem getting back into the swing of things.
This is a great start—so let’s keep going! Why don’t you head out and see what other Pokémon you can discover?
While you do, I’ll stay here and start researching the ones you caught already.
I’m counting on you, %PLAYERNAME%!
Excellent work, %PLAYERNAME%!
Thanks to your recent efforts, I’ve got plenty of research topics to keep me occupied—for now, anyway.
I’ll be sure to reach out whenever I need a hand.
Until then, I hope you have a wonderful time exploring the world around you and meeting all sorts of incredible Pokémon!
Now, let’s GO!
Good morning, %PLAYERNAME%! There sure seems to be a surplus of Sandshrew around today, don’t you think?
I’m especially surprised to see both Sandshrew and Alolan Sandshrew appearing at once!
These two forms of Sandshrew usually prefer vastly different climates. Sandshrew usually make their homes in deserts and arid zones, where rain doesn’t fall.
Alolan Sandshrew, on the other hand, are typically found in snowy mountains. What an uncommon sight for them to both be here together!
How about you spend some time with them and see what they’re up to, %PLAYERNAME%?
Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! That’s an impressive number of Sandshrew you have in tow. I’d love to take a closer look at them—especially their shells.
Did you know that there’s a traditional competition in Alolan festivals where Trainers slide Alolan Sandshrew across ice as far as possible?
How must the Sandshrew feel about that, I wonder!
The Sandshrew first found in the Kanto region are quite fascinating in their own right.
When their skin gets wrinkled from moisture, they head for volcanoes and lie flat on a spot with a lot of geothermal heat to dry themselves out.
It’s truly incredible how different geography and climates can influence Pokémon.
I’d love to get an even closer look at both of these forms of Sandshrew. What do you say, %PLAYERNAME%? Let’s get back out there!
You never disappoint, %PLAYERNAME%! Seeing all the Sandshrew together, don’t they look like a tough bunch?
Sandshrew evolve into Sandslash, another hardy Pokémon. Alolan Sandslash use their large, hooked claws to cut paths through deep snow as they run.
On snowy mountains, these Sandslash are faster than any other Pokémon.
But Sandslash first found in Kanto are tough, too! They climb trees by hooking on with their sharp claws.
They even share the Berries they gather by dropping them down to Sandshrew waiting on the ground. If only I could gather Berries so easily...
Try and evolve Sandshrew to Sandslash for yourself, %PLAYERNAME%!
Great work, %PLAYERNAME%. Your new Sandslash are an impressive sight—befitting an impressive Trainer such as yourself!
Up close, you can really appreciate the differences in the spikes of these Sandslash.
The drier the area Sandslash lives in, the harder and smoother their spikes feel.
Meanwhile, Alolan Sandslash have beautiful icy spikes that glisten in the light of dawn.
Thanks for helping me look into these Sandshrew today, %PLAYERNAME%.
I’ll keep studying Sandshrew and Sandslash in hopes of discovering more differences and similarities between them!
And I’ll be sure to get in touch the next time I need a helping hand. Something tells me it won’t be long!
Until next time, let’s GO!
Great to see you, %PLAYERNAME%! We’ve got a golden day of research ahead of us. I can’t wait to get started!
Say, are you looking forward to finding one of these Pokémon? I’ve got a good feeling about them!
Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! It’s good to see you.
As you know, I’ve recently been conducting research on several different regions in the world of Pokémon. Along the way, I came across some books that collected stories and legends from various regions.
One of these tomes told of three Legendary Pokémon from the Unova region—a trio that seem to be capable of changing formes.
Needless to say, that piqued my interest, and I became so enveloped in my research that I even began seeing those three Legendary Pokémon in my dreams!
Which brings me to why I called you here. Can you help me with some research, Trainer? I was thinking we could start by catching some Rock-type Pokémon—you know, just to give ourselves a sturdy foundation to build from.
...Get it? Sturdy? Because they’re...Rock-type? A-anyway, I’d appreciate the help. Let’s GO!
Welcome back, Trainer. Now that we’ve established a foundation for our research, we need to narrow our focus.
There are three stories I want to investigate, so I think the best approach is to focus on one story at a time and see what we can learn.
My hope is to discover as much as we can about these Pokémon, so that when we see clues or signs of their appearance, we’re as prepared as possible!
This first story tells of a Legendary Pokémon called Landorus. The story says that lands visited by Landorus yield such bountiful crops that it’s been hailed as “The Guardian of the Fields.”
Landorus seems to have two formes: Incarnate Forme, and the very rarely seen Therian Forme. I haven’t been able to find any imagery depicting the latter, but every source I’ve read agrees on its existence!
For now, why don’t we research Ground-type Pokémon? Maybe in doing so we can better equip ourselves to identify Landorus’s Therian Forme when the time comes.
Thank you, %PLAYERNAME%. I think we’ve gained a better understanding of Landorus after studying Ground-type Pokémon.
And is that a Drilbur you’ve got there? I dig it! ...Haha! Sorry, sorry.
Anyway, since we’ve explored all our leads on Landorus for the moment, what do you say we move on to another Pokémon from my dream?
Let’s focus on Tornadus next. The texts say Tornadus expels massive energy from its tail, causing severe storms, and that its power is great enough to blow houses away.
Like Landorus, Tornadus also has both Incarnate and Therian Formes. Hmm... Maybe researching Flying-type Pokémon in the area is our best bet for now? Let’s give it a shot, Trainer!
Excellent work, Trainer! Thanks for documenting that information about Tornadus. It seems you even found yourself a darling Ducklett along the way! Is it all it’s quacked up to be? Haha!
I think we’ve learned everything we can about Tornadus for now. Its Therian Forme is still a mystery, but hopefully not for long!
Before we start investigating the final Legendary Pokémon from my dream, I need to share something...strange.
You see, I’d been running myself a bit ragged with research, so I stopped for an afternoon nap. In the resulting dream, I saw those three Unovan Legendary Pokémon again, clear as crystal. But then, the whole dream just started...fading.
It was almost like something was eating the dream itself. I’m still not sure what to make of it all, but let's stay on the lookout for anything suspicious. I have a hunch this may be the work of a Pokémon nearby.
For now, though, let’s continue our research and turn our attention to the last of the three Unovan Legendary Pokémon detailed in those stories—Thundurus.
Thundurus is known as the Bolt Strike Pokémon, and its story also references both Incarnate and Therian Formes. The spikes on its tail are said to discharge immense bolts of lightning.
For the sake of consistency, let’s go ahead and research Electric-type Pokémon in the area as we compile our notes on Thundurus.
Ah, there you are, %PLAYERNAME%. I have something big to share!
But first, I want to thank you for all your hard work collecting information on Landorus, Tornadus, and Thundurus.
I feel confident that when the time comes, you’ll be prepared to encounter any of these amazing Legendary Pokémon—regardless of which forme they appear in.
Now—do you remember that strange experience I had where my dream began fading inexplicably? I think I may have finally uncovered the cause.
While consulting the Pokédex for possible culprits, I came across an entry for a Pokémon called Munna. It’s known as the Dream Eater Pokémon—so you can see why it caught my eye!
Munna is said to eat the dreams of both people and Pokémon, expelling mist as a result. The mist is pink if the dream is pleasant, and black if it’s a nightmare.
I was pretty pleased to be dreaming of those Unovan Legendary Pokémon again, so I suspect Munna’s mist was nice and rosy that day!
Munna seems like a fascinating Pokémon, and I can’t wait to research it more. I hope you’ll give me a hand when the time comes, Trainer! Now, let’s GO!
Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! I’m glad you’re here. A new adventure is about to begin!
Not long ago, various Legendary Pokémon began emerging from mysterious rings that suddenly appeared in the sky. After some research, we discovered it was Hoopa, the Mischief Pokémon, that was responsible.
Hoopa’s rings allow it to teleport things—including itself—wherever it wants. That power makes it hard to track down, but for some reason, Hoopa seems to keep returning to this area.
How do I know? Well, I was doing some lab work recently when my glasses were lifted straight off my head. Spark was there assisting me, and he said he saw a small, lavender-colored hand emerge from a ring and snatch my glasses. Pretty cheeky, eh?
Luckily, he and Candela managed to retrieve my spectacles by chasing down the rings that were popping up at random around my mobile lab. So, at least I can still see. Haha!
Needless to say, I’m still not sure why Hoopa’s here. Tracking it down has been difficult, but with your help, I’m sure we’ll crack the case in no time!
For now, why don’t you try using an Incense to see what Pokémon you can find in the area?
... ... ...
BOO! Haha, did I scare you? Not too badly, I hope.
Let’s continue our investigation into these eerie events. Don’t worry—I won’t send you into any rickety mansions or foggy forests.
I was actually doing some research near a forest myself recently, and I found a rather odd-looking tree. I’ve learned over the years to trust my gut when something seems strange in the field—chances are it’s a Pokémon!
I couldn’t help but indulge my curiosity, and I stepped toward the tree to observe it more closely. As soon as I did, the tree pivoted on its roots and stared me down with a single red eye!
It didn’t take long for me to realize I was standing before a Trevenant, the Elder Tree Pokémon. Trevenant will trap people who harm their forest, never allowing them to leave.
It must have sensed that I was just there for research because it turned back around and ignored me. Its attention then turned to the many Phantump gathered around it.
That’s when I realized that Trevenant was harvesting Berries from the nearby trees to feed the Phantump! Trevenant is known to offer great kindness to forest-dwelling Pokémon, and it was lovely to witness it myself.
Ghost-type Pokémon can seem frightening at first glance, but look a little closer and you’ll find they’re full of surprises. I’m sure the same goes for Hoopa!
I have a feeling there’s more to Hoopa than its penchant for mischief. Maybe we’ll find some answers after we conduct some more research on Ghost-type Pokémon.
Great work, %PLAYERNAME%! As we close out our spooky investigations, I have a feeling there are some bright things on the horizon for us to explore together soon. I’ll be sure to let you know when I have something to share!
Well hello, %PLAYERNAME%! Welcome back. It’s around this time of year that nights in the Northern Hemisphere begin growing longer and longer. The sun shines brighter while it’s up, though, so it’s a pretty fair trade!
If you ask me, this is a prime opportunity to ponder the power of light and darkness—both literally and metaphorically. I wonder what darkness our little friend Hoopa has had to overcome? I have a feeling its mischievous reputation may hang over it like a shadow at times.
What’s more, I can’t help but wonder how and why its power was confined.
Pokémon are an endless source of mystery. We may never know all their secrets, but it’s a researcher’s job to shine a light into the darkest depths of the unknown and illuminate whatever answers we can!
For me, darkness is an opportunity to learn something new. To make discoveries! We’ve learned so much about Hoopa in our research, and in some ways, I think we may have learned a bit about ourselves, too.
But enough of my rambling! How about you head on out there and enjoy the light, %PLAYERNAME%? You’ve earned it.
I’m glad to see you again, Trainer! I was out on a walk and got to thinking about your journey with Hoopa thus far.
It seems that Hoopa’s really taken a shine to you. Do you think it may show us more of its power soon? A professor can dream, I suppose.
Why don’t you check back again in a bit, %PLAYERNAME%, after you’ve spent a tad more time with Hoopa.
I’m glad to see you, %PLAYERNAME%. I wish I had better news, but it looks like Team GO Rocket is stirring up trouble once again!
While out on patrol, Spark and Candela overheard some Team GO Rocket Grunts discussing the organization’s next move. They want to capture Hoopa! It seems their orders came straight from Giovanni himself.
I shudder to think that all this time Giovanni may have been lurking in the shadows just behind us, reaping the benefits of our research. Scheming as we studied Hoopa...
There’s no time to lose—we have to stop them! Hoopa Unbound is incredibly powerful, and I have no doubt that Giovanni intends to use it for some sinister purpose.
You know better than most, %PLAYERNAME%: Hoopa may be capable of terrifying things, but it’s still a Pokémon. It must be protected!
We’ve also gotten word that Giovanni has turned another Legendary Pokémon into a Shadow Pokémon! The team leaders and I will do what we can, but we’ll need your help if we’re to defeat Giovanni, save the Legendary Shadow Pokémon, and keep Hoopa safe.
Incredible work, %PLAYERNAME%! You’ve successfully defeated Team GO Rocket yet again and saved another Legendary Shadow Pokémon—and Hoopa, too!
Speaking of Hoopa, I have a sneaking suspicion that because of your kindness, we might just be lucky enough to witness it as Hoopa Unbound someday soon. What a sight that will be, eh?
We’ve come a long way in our research, and unlocking Hoopa’s true power may be the final trial in this mysterious saga. Are you ready, Trainer? Let’s GO!
As with all great mysteries, solving this will take time, patience, and trust. I’ll need to work alone at some points, but I promise I’ll return to share my findings and help propel us forward.
You just keep exploring the world as you always do. You never know what you might find!
I’ll report back here once I have more information on Hoopa. Thanks in advance for your help, %PLAYERNAME%!
Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! It’s so good to see you again. Have you managed to spot Hoopa anywhere?
Although some think of Hoopa as a mischievous troublemaker, really all it wants to do is have fun!
Speaking of fun, it seems Hoopa had a blast filling up my mobile lab with Pinap Berries. Maybe it spotted me happily digging into some during my lunch break and decided I could use a few more.
It was a bit of a surprise when I opened the lab door and piles of Pinap Berries poured out! It took a while to clean everything up—but my lab did smell amazing afterward, so it wasn’t all bad.
It was nice having an excuse to clean—not to mention I have enough Pinap Berries to last me for days. I might even make some jam...
Anyway, Hoopa sure has seemed a lot friendlier these days, hasn’t it? I think it’s been having lots of fun interacting with us. Maybe that’s why it’s been bringing all sorts of surprises into our world.
Who knows—you might be able to catch it now!
Wow, %PLAYERNAME%! I can't believe you caught Hoopa!
Normally I’d say we’re done with our research, but I wouldn’t be surprised if Hoopa continued to cause mischief.
It seems there’s still much for us to learn about this Pokémon!
By the way, I’ve noticed that some Psychic-type Pokémon have been appearing around my lab. Could Hoopa’s presence be the cause?
Perhaps we’ll be able to use this as an opportunity to research Psychic-type Pokémon, including Hoopa. I’ll have to investigate this phenomenon further, and I’ll let you know when I’ve learned more. Until next time!
Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! I’ve noticed an increase in the number of Psychic-type Pokémon appearing around my mobile lab of late.
Whenever something like this happens, I can’t help but get excited about researching the cause!
As you may recall, the Mythical Pokémon Hoopa is a Psychic and Ghost type. I have a hunch its recent appearances might be causing the uptick in Psychic-type Pokémon in these parts.
What’s more, I believe we may be able to learn more about Hoopa by researching other Psychic-type Pokémon. There’s one in particular that’s caught my attention: Inkay.
My colleague in the Kalos region told me that Inkay is known as the Revolving Pokémon, and that it evolves in a unique way.
I’m ashamed to say I’ve forgotten the details, but I do remember him saying “upside-down” several times during his explanation. If only I could remember why...
Maybe it’s my one-track mind speaking, but I immediately think of Hoopa when I hear “upside-down”—because its appearance turned our world right on its head! Haha!
Hey, Trainer! Have you noticed that Hoopa has continued to cause mischief? Its tricks are always unexpected, but I do feel like Hoopa’s brought some welcome color to our lives.
Speaking of colorful things, I’ve heard reports that there’s a certain Pokémon nearby that’s known to have multiple appearances. Keep your eyes peeled for me, won’t you?
In the meantime, I’m going to analyze everything we’ve learned about Psychic-type Pokémon thus far. Hopefully it’ll point us in the right direction to continue our research on Pokémon forms—and Hoopa!
Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! I’ve noticed that some Pokémon wearing costumes have been appearing around my lab lately. Isn’t it fun to change up your look every once in a while?
Speaking of, have you encountered any Furfrou yet? Also known as the Poodle Pokémon, Furfrou is famous for the variety of looks it can achieve when a Trainer trims its coat—10 in all!
Why don’t we stay on the lookout for Furfrou and see if we can learn more about changing its appearance? Who knows—maybe we’ll learn more about other Pokémon along the way!
Great job catching that Furfrou, Trainer! Did you know there are also other Pokémon that’re known to change their appearance? That includes one we’ve spent a lot of time researching lately: Hoopa.
Hoopa is known to have two forms. So far, you and I have seen it as Hoopa Confined, but I hear its power increases astronomically when it becomes Hoopa Unbound.
I wonder if we’ll ever get to witness it ourselves. I suppose all we can do for now is continue our research.
In fact, Blanche has been receiving reports of some spooky occurrences out in the field. We’re not quite sure what the cause is, but like all things lately, we can’t rule out Hoopa’s involvement.
Hoopa’s no stranger to mischief, and you never know how it’ll use its rings next, so I think further investigation is in order.
I’ll be sure to share more details with you when I have them, %PLAYERNAME%. Now, let’s GO!
Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! It’s nice to see a friendly face—because I’ve been seeing a lot of spooky Pokémon staring at me lately!
Do you think this might be Hoopa’s doing? Hoopa’s known to transport Pokémon and people to different places with its rings, so maybe that’s what’s happening here.
After all those Legendary Pokémon appeared during this year’s GO Fest—as well as those Pokémon first found in Galar that appeared more recently—I’d say Hoopa’s involvement here is more than likely.
Perhaps we can learn more about Hoopa by studying the Ghost-type Pokémon that have begun to show up nearby. Mind giving me a hand, Trainer?
Thanks for conducting that research, Trainer. We certainly know more than we did, but not enough to explain why these spooky occurrences are still...well, occurring.
Let’s do a bit more research on Ghost-type Pokémon then, shall we?
Hello, %PLAYERNAME%! It’s great to see you.
I can’t thank you and Rhi enough for bringing me back from beyond the Ultra Wormhole. The two of you are quite the team!
As exhilarating as it was to explore a different dimension, it wasn’t without its challenges. Thoughts of home kept me calm—you, Meltan, the team leaders...
Maybe it was the sheer strength of those memories, but more than once it seemed almost like I was being surrounded by a protective presence—warm like the sun and calm like the moon.
Who knows—maybe there really was something watching out for me! Our world can’t be the only one full of mysteries, after all.
Speaking of mysteries, I have a new one to share with you, %PLAYERNAME%. Since my return, a small, gaseous Pokémon I’ve never seen before has been hanging around my lab.
It seems friendly, but where did it come from?  Did it follow me from beyond the Ultra Wormhole? Could it be an Ultra Beast?
Considering that possibility, I think it would be best if you work with Rhi to raise this Pokémon. Naturally, I’ll be eager to hear anything you may learn in the process.
Greetings, %PLAYERNAME%. So, Professor Willow confirmed he felt a presence like this Legendary Pokémon on the other side of the Ultra Wormhole?
It would seem my theory was correct, then. A Pokémon of its kind protected Professor Willow during his disappearance.
Pokémon are such wonderful creatures. I will have to make note of this behavior.
You’re marvelous too, %PLAYERNAME%—a kind and strong Pokémon Trainer.
I am at ease knowing that someone so capable is keeping an eye on the Ultra Beasts.
And more importantly, I am honored to call someone like you a friend.
Ahem. Now, I believe a status report is in order.
This world is sufficiently capable of defending itself against threats from the Ultra Wormholes.
However, we have yet to discern the origin of—or inciting force behind—the Ultra Wormholes. I ran some tests as you conversed with Professor Willow and determined that our Pokémon friend here is not responsible.
At least one mystery yet persists. It would seem more adventures lie on the horizon for us, %PLAYERNAME%. Until our next!
Greetings, Pokémon Trainer. With the Ultra Beasts presently at bay, now is an opportune moment to reflect on our time together thus far.
The Ultra Wormholes and the dangers they pose were my primary concerns upon arriving in this world. But now, I find myself equally invested in developing our relationship.
In light of our new rapport, perhaps it is time I reintroduced myself.
I am Rhi of the GO Ultra Recon Squad. It is a pleasure to be your friend, %PLAYERNAME%.
Is there any objective I may assist you with today?
Your Professor Willow has asked us to rear and study a peculiar Pokémon, is it? Understood.
Ah. I have heard tales of such a Pokémon.
Its gentle glow is impossible to mistake. I believe this Pokémon is called...Cosmog.
Come—let us show Cosmog the beauty of this world.
Hm? You wish to know more of Cosmog?
Some have said that in ages past, it was known as the child of the stars.
Beyond that, few details are known.
Perhaps you and I can shed some light on this peculiar Pokémon.
Earning its trust seems like a logical first step.
Do you think Cosmog would feel closer to us if it were given a nickname?
Its visage reminds me of outer space... A nebula, perhaps.
But never mind my musings. I will leave the decision to you, %PLAYERNAME%.
No matter the name, I am eager to learn more of Cosmog as we become better acquainted.
Hey, %PLAYERNAME%! Great to see you, as always. 
How have you and Rhi been? Have you two learned any more about that mysterious Pokémon?
Rhi recognizes it, you say? And its name is Cosmog? Incredible! Having a bit of extra-dimensional help really expands our knowledge base.
Still, when it comes to Pokémon research, nothing beats firsthand observation. Have you gleaned anything interesting during your time with Cosmog, %PLAYERNAME%?
Hmm... I see.
Sounds like Cosmog’s curious, but not very cautious.
I can relate to throwing caution to the wind, but when you’re light enough to be blown away by the slightest breeze... Well.
It’s a good thing you and Rhi are there to make sure Cosmog is safe—just like you were for me!
Anyhow, the more time you spend with Cosmog, the more we’ll learn. Let me know when you make more discoveries!
%PLAYERNAME%. Greetings.
So, Cosmog has evolved into Cosmoem.
Do not be troubled by its current state.
This is its natural biology at work.
Though Cosmoem lies inert, energy is building within its core.
I suspect it is preparing to evolve and will become active again in due time.
Precisely when that will happen is beyond my knowledge, however.
Once Cosmoem evolves, I wonder... Wait. I am struck by a thought. Recall how Willow spoke of a presence “warm like the sun and calm like the moon.”
I apologize for the abrupt interruption of our conversation, %PLAYERNAME%, but I must make some notes.
Please continue your exploration in my absence and apprise Professor Willow of Cosmog’s evolution into Cosmoem.
%PLAYERNAME%, you’re back already! How’s Cosmog—
Whoa! Who’s that Pokémon? Did Cosmog evolve?! Just look at that lustrous shell!
Rhi’s hypothesis is that this “Cosmoem” will stay in this state until it’s ready to evolve? Excellent theory!
It’s definitely easier to get an up-close look at a Pokémon holding still, but what do you think is going on in Cosmoem’s mind? Is it asleep? Maybe it’s dreaming of adventuring with you and Rhi!
What else will we learn once it “becomes active,” as Rhi put it? What kind of Pokémon could it become? Unlike our serene friend here, my mind’s buzzing with questions and possibilities!
I can’t wait to see what mysteries we’ll unravel, %PLAYERNAME%! Keep taking good care of Cosmoem until then.
Still in a holding pattern with Cosmoem, %PLAYERNAME%? Not to worry—sometimes slow and steady is the way to go. I’ll be waiting right here, so come see me when you have an update to share.
Oh? Did you see that, %PLAYERNAME%?
Cosmoem seems to be stirring.
It appears the time has finally come.
We’ll soon be able to observe the splendor of Cosmoem evolving with our own eyes.
In...incredible! Cosmoem has evolved!
Splendid! Scintillating, even—to witness such a stunning sight firsthand.
This Pokémon holds the power to open Ultra Wormholes. Others of its kind frequently join the GO Ultra Recon Squad in our investigations. They assist us in traversing dimensions.
Though it remains to be seen how this particular specimen initially made its way here...
I’d like to observe how it acclimates to this world in its new form. Our friend has changed greatly since we first came across it as Cosmog. And you must show Professor Willow this dazzling development.
Do be sure to share his impressions with me.
%PLAYERNAME%! Great to see you—and that majestic Pokémon you’ve brought with you!
Unless I’ve gotten my wires crossed, I believe that’s a Legendary Pokémon originally discovered in Alola. How did you come across it?
Wha—it evolved from Cosmoem?!
I’m awestruck! And...struck with the exact same calm, warm feeling I had on the other side of the Ultra Wormhole.
Hmm... Could a Pokémon of this species have been looking out for me?
Funny, isn’t it? I’m always thinking about how we can protect Pokémon. But it looks like this time, a Pokémon protected me!
I’ve got one more friend to be thankful for, aside from you and Rhi.
I knew leaving Cosmog with you two was the right choice. With your encouragement and guidance, it’s become something truly Legendary!
Do me a favor, would you? Keep adventuring together and tell me all about your exploits when you have a chance.
As for me, well... I think it’s about time I put my old lab coat back on. Don’t you?
Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%!
I’m so glad you’re here. Get this—there’ve been sightings of Shaymin in the area!
Well, it might be more accurate to say “potential sightings,” as I’ve yet to verify the information.
Shaymin lives in common flower patches but is rarely noticed. It’s often mistaken for a flowering plant when curled up—what unique behavior for a Mythical Pokémon!
I can’t help but wonder if we’d know more about Shaymin if only we were a little more observant.
Let’s put that theory to the test and see what we can learn taking a good look around the area, shall we?
How did it go, %PLAYERNAME%? Any chance you ran into Shaymin while you were out?
No? Well, that’s OK! I see you got some good snapshots of other Pokémon in the meantime.
Hmm... That gets me thinking. As you might know, the flowers all over Shaymin burst into bloom if it’s lovingly hugged and senses gratitude.
I hypothesize that if we take the time to share some thankfulness, we’ll attract Shaymin’s attention.
Not that we need any excuse to celebrate Pokémon, I say! In fact, how about we appreciate them in photo form with some more snapshots, %PLAYERNAME%?
Your snapshots look great, %PLAYERNAME%! You’ve got a real knack for catching Pokémon—both in Poké Balls and on camera!
And y’know what else you’ve got a knack for? Pokémon battles!
I’m sure you already know that one of the ways you can keep your team in tip-top shape is by powering up your Pokémon. Why don’t you do that and come see me when you’re done?
Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%!
I was just thinking about Shaymin again. One of the many things that makes Shaymin so special is that it has two known forms.
I refer, of course, to its Land Forme and Sky Forme. Land Forme Shaymin is Grass-type, but when it turns into Sky Forme Shaymin, it becomes Grass- and Flying-type.
Some say that it transforms when it takes in the scent of a rare flower.
Perhaps you’re wondering what would happen if a human took a whiff. A researcher from long ago tried just that, but alas, his body remained unchanged.
Ah well. Not all hypotheses hold water. That’s just part of the scientific process!
And speaking of learning, why don’t you spend some time with other Grass-type Pokémon and Flying-type Pokémon? Maybe they’ll inspire you to make some hypotheses of your own!
Excellent work, %PLAYERNAME%. Now you’ve got even more Pokémon to bring along on your journey!
In the spirit of Shaymin being the Gratitude Pokémon, let’s show some gratitude to our old and newfound friends alike.
How about taking some snapshots with your Pokémon or feeding them some tasty Berries? I know my beloved Meltan always enjoys a snack—maybe your Pokémon are the same!
Your Pokémon are positively glowing, %PLAYERNAME%! I’m sure they appreciated that extra quality time with you.
The more time I spend with Pokémon, the more I appreciate all their unique qualities.
For example, Torchic is oh-so-cuddly. It has fire burning inside it, so hugging it is lovely and warm. Then there’s Mudkip, who contains amazing power—it can crush rocks bigger than itself.
I could also wax poetic about Treecko, whose feet are covered by countless tiny spikes, enabling it to walk on walls and ceilings.
And that’s just a scant three Pokémon! I’d love to hear your observations too, %PLAYERNAME%. What unique Pokémon and traits can you observe?
%PLAYERNAME%! Yay—it’s Shaymin!
It looks happy—I daresay even grateful—to be in the care of an exemplary Trainer like you!
And as long as we’re on the subject, I want you to know I’m incredibly thankful you helped me with my research.
I know it’s not always easy, but I can’t tell you enough how much I appreciate your contributions to my studies.
Studies that never end, I might add. Haha. So rest up, and I’ll be in contact again soon.
Let’s GO...with gratitude!
Hey there %PLAYERNAME%! Hope you’ve been well.
The strangest thing happened last night: I noticed a veritable bevy of bobbing, blinking lights bouncing around at the far end of a nearby park—but by the time I’d run over, the area was empty and dark.
I have a feeling those flickering lights may somehow be connected to an Electric-type Pokémon, but I can’t be sure!
How about we do a little investigating, hm? Maybe those Pokémon are still nearby.
Well, would you look at that! It’s Shinx, the Flash Pokémon!
Considering all I’ve heard about this cute little creature, I have a theory.
Shinx sends signals to others of its kind by shaking the tip of its lit-up tail.
Last night’s anomaly was likely a group of Shinx having a chat!
Now that you’ve caught a Shinx, why don’t we do some research into its Evolution, Luxio?
Strong electricity courses through the tips of Luxio’s sharp claws. What a shocking combination! Let’s learn more about it, shall we?
Well done, %PLAYERNAME%—you’ve got yourself a Luxio!
Also known as the Spark Pokémon, Luxio can receive a bit of other Luxio’s electricity by joining their tails together.
So, Shinx can use their tails to communicate with one another, and Luxio can gather their tails together to collectively generate powerful electricity. Fascinating!
I wonder what else there is to learn about this Pokémon’s Evolutionary line. How about you evolve your Luxio and we find out for ourselves!
Ah, Luxray, the Gleam Eyes Pokémon! When its eyes gleam gold, it can spot hidden prey—even through thick walls.
But seeing through solid objects uses a lot of its electricity, so Luxray sleep for long periods of time to store up energy.
What an electrifying revelation! We’ve learned a lot about Shinx and its Evolutions, but I bet there’s still much to discover.
Despite all that hard work, it seems you’ve still got a little spark left in you—so why don’t you head back out and see what other adventures await? Let’s GO!
%PLAYERNAME%! It is fortunate you are here. Alarming events have transpired.
As I was observing a slow, pink Pokémon, its tail suddenly fell off. I stooped down to pick up the tail, only to discover that the field was covered in more of these detached appendages.
The Pokémon in question did not seem perturbed. However, I am. Could a disease be ailing the Pokémon? Are the fallen extremities separate life-forms?
Please assist me in assessing the situation, %PLAYERNAME%.
Hey, %PLAYERNAME%! I saw you and Rhi running around earlier. What’ve you been up to?
There were Pokémon with their tails falling off? That does sound concerning, but I’ve got a hunch there’s nothing to worry about. Let me have a look!
Hmm... Yep! You’ll both be relieved to know these are just Slowpoke tails. Their tails fall off naturally. The Slowpoke don’t feel any pain when it happens, and their tails grow back, so they aren’t particularly bothered.
Speaking of their tails, did you know that because Galarian Slowpoke eat the seeds of a plant that grows only in Galar, their tails have developed a spicy flavor?
So I hear, at least—I’ve never tasted one myself. Ooh, maybe we should have a picnic sometime!
Ahem. Lunch plans aside, I’ll let Rhi know that there’s no cause for concern. Spend more time with the Slowpoke till I’m back, %PLAYERNAME%!
Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%. Whoa! Not only have you spent more time with Slowpoke, but you’ve helped some evolve, too!
Slowpoke’s pretty special. Not only can it evolve into one of two different Pokémon—Slowbro and Slowking—but each of its Evolutions has regional variants, too.
Slowpoke become Water- and Psychic-type Slowbro when Shellder latch on to their tails. Though usually dim-witted, they seem to become inspired if those Shellder bite down.
Galarian Slowbro, unlike their non-Galarian counterparts, are Poison types.
When a Shellder bites one of them, it sets off a chemical reaction with the spices inside Slowbro’s body, causing Slowbro to become a Poison-type Pokémon. Pretty wild, huh?
Evolve a couple more Slowpoke, and I’ll have some fun facts about Slowking to share when you’re back!
Back so soon, %PLAYERNAME%? You’re faster than a Slowpoke, that’s for sure! Now for those Slowking facts I promised you.
Slowking undertake research every day in an effort to solve the mysteries of the world. They have incredible intellect and intuition. Whatever the situation, they remain calm and collected.
Galarian Slowking, on the other hand, have something of a spooky bent. While chanting strange spells, these Pokémon combine their internal toxins with what they’ve eaten, creating strange potions.
What do you think would happen if I drank one of those potions? Maybe I’d turn into a Slowking myself. Who knows what I could accomplish with their level of intellect!
Ah... You’re right, it might be hard for me to communicate like that. Either way, there’s no end to the discoveries we can make about Pokémon together—even if my noggin remains Shellder-free! Haha.
The curiosity of friends like you and Rhi will take us far. I hope you two learned something today. Until next time, %PLAYERNAME%!
Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! Perfect timing.
I just got back from a lengthy stroll in the sunshine. It’s incredible how much a bit of fresh air can affect your energy and mood!
But that’s not the only thing that’s got me feeling chipper. You see, I witnessed something quite interesting while I was out and about.
Perhaps in response to the abundant sunlight, a congregation of Snivy appears to have formed nearby.
I don’t know about you, but this seems to me like a golden opportunity to research the Grass Snake Pokémon. Could you lend me a hand?
They’re known to be fairly calm, so you shouldn’t have much trouble observing them.
Good luck out there!
Welcome back, Trainer! Great work.
I have some information for you on why Snivy are so fond of the sun.
These Grass-type Pokémon photosynthesize by bathing their tails in sunlight. Much like the sunshine they crave, Snivy are quite bright!
They were first encountered in the Unova region, where they were known for their intelligence and calm demeanor. Fascinating!
While we continue researching their sudden appearance, could you evolve a Snivy for me? I’d like to document its Evolution, Servine.
Take care when you do, however—Servine is known for its masterful whipping techniques.
Wonderful work, %PLAYERNAME%! That’s a mighty fine Servine.
Like Snivy, Servine is known as the Grass Snake Pokémon. It moves along the ground as if sliding. Though it’s far from sluggish, it won’t hesitate to seek out the shadows of thick foliage to avoid attacks.
Now that we’ve properly documented Snivy and Servine, I’d like to move on to Serperior, Snivy’s final Evolution.
Serperior is known as the Regal Pokémon, and much like Snivy and Servine, it also has a penchant for sunlight. It takes in solar energy and boosts it internally.
Could you evolve your Servine into Serperior for me, Trainer? It’ll be a great boon to my research, and you’ll have a powerful Grass-type Pokémon to join your journey as well!
Fantastic work, Trainer! I have no doubt Serperior will prove a potent asset on your adventures.
It has an incredible ability to stop its opponents’ movements with a single glare. Should the opponent prove bold enough to continue, Serperior will give its all in battle.
Having a Pokémon like that by your side would be pretty inspiring, I’d say!
Anyway, thanks again for all your help in this sun-soaked endeavor. I think I’ll take one more walk before the day’s done—can’t let weather like this go to waste!
Until next time, let’s GO!
Hey! %PLAYERNAME%! No time to explain—take this Incubator and follow me, quick!
Phew! Appreciate the hustle, %PLAYERNAME%. Did you use that Incubator I gave you?
I bet you’re curious why we’re in a hurry.
It’s because Elekid ran off—right as I took my eyes off it to put an Egg in that Incubator!
To be fair, this isn’t the first time my Elekid’s gotten a case of the zoomies. I think it just gets restless sometimes. And hey, chasing after it is a great way to get my daily steps in!
As for that Incubator, I had a feeling you’d be up for helping me track down Elekid and thought, “Why not hatch an Egg along the way?”
Professor Willow tells me you’re no stranger to hatching Pokémon. I’d love to hear all about your escapades, so c’mon, dish!
Actually, hold that thought—I think I see Elekid over thataway! After it, %PLAYERNAME%! We can chat on the way!
Wanna hear more about what I’ve been up to?
Okay, so, I had this wild idea that exposing Pokémon Eggs to different kinds of music might influence what interests they develop as they grow up.
No results yet, but I’ve been making a lotta playlists. Ooh, you should share some of your favorite tunes with me later!
I’m getting excited. Haha. Thinking about Pokémon always amps me up!
Like, how do they instinctively develop so many unique characteristics? And at the same time, they all have their own personalities!
For example, Elekid are known to rotate their arms to generate electricity, but they supposedly tire easily. And then there’s my Elekid, who’s always running off.
That’s what makes my buddy so charming, though! I wouldn’t have it any other way.
What’s your Buddy Pokémon like, %PLAYERNAME%? You should ask it to join us while we track down Elekid. I’m itching to see if your buddy’s personality is anything like yours!
A-HA! Elekid spotted dead ahead! And it looks like it’s tuckered itself out.
Our wild Pokémon chase is finally coming to an end.
Y’know, I bet things only went as smoothly as they did because you were here.
I didn’t even have to worry about Team GO Rocket trying to mess with us!
Come to think of it, they’ve been weirdly preoccupied lately... But hey, I’m not about to look a gift Horsea in the mouth.
Enough about them, though. Thanks again for being my hero today, %PLAYERNAME%! I dunno how long it would’ve taken me to chase down Elekid without your help.
Well, I’ve got places to be and Eggs to hatch, but don’t be a stranger! Let’s chat again real soon!
Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! It’s great to see you again.
I wanted to tell you about what I saw on my morning walk today—a herd of Spheal rolling across an icy lake!
Did you know that a Spheal always travels by rolling around on its ball-like body?
When the season for ice floes arrives, Spheal can be seen rolling about on ice and crossing the sea.
They’re also covered in fluffy fur to keep them from feeling cold in icy climes. And I’ll tell you, seeing them tumble to-and-fro warmed me right up, too!
Why don’t you go check out some Spheal for yourself?
Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! I see you’ve brought some Spheal with you. Aren’t they just the roundest?
According to my research, the Evolution of Spheal, Sealeo, seems to agree! Sealeo can occasionally be seen entertaining itself by balancing a Spheal on its nose as if juggling a ball.
In fact, when Sealeo sees just about anything for the first time, it tends to try juggling it on its nose! Why don’t you evolve your Spheal and see for yourself?
Welcome back, Trainer—and hello there, Sealeo!
I have some breaking news for you. Remember that icy lake I told you about earlier?
Well, it looks like something’s broken it up, and now all the Spheal are splashing around in the water! They seem to be having fun, but I wonder what Pokémon could have caused this.
My best guess is Walrein. Walrein is known to swim through frigid water while crushing icebergs with its grand, imposing tusks. Sounds pretty magnificent, if a bit imposing.
Can you evolve your Sealeo so we can research Walrein ourselves?
You did it, Trainer! Walrein’s tusks really are magnificent up close, aren’t they?
Did you know that Walrein typically gather in herds of about 20 or 30? When a threat appears, the herd’s leader will do whatever it takes to protect the group.
Nice to know they can look after themselves—though considering those tusks, I don’t think that was ever in doubt. Haha!
I’m sure your Walrein will protect you in battle as well. You already look like quite a powerful pair!
Thanks for going on this adventure with me today, %PLAYERNAME%! I’ve learned a lot from the research you conducted. Until next time, let’s GO!
Oh, %PLAYERNAME%! You’ve dropped by just in time.
As I was out on my regular walk one evening, I stumbled upon this odd stone. Something told me to bring it back to my lab for further research, and ever since then, strange things have been happening.
Papers shifting around, water glasses tipping all by themselves...
When I tried using my computer to research it, I got an error message with the number 108 flashing! %PLAYERNAME%, can you help gather some data on nearby Ghost-type Pokémon?
I have to believe we can solve these spooky occurrences with science!
%PLAYERNAME%, thanks so much for your help. I did some research on Ghost-type Pokémon, and I think there’s a Ghost- and Dark-type Pokémon that is bound to a strange stone.
I can’t say for sure just yet, but it seems this Pokémon may actually be composed of 108 spirits bound together. So maybe if we catch 108 Pokémon, it will appear?
Good luck, %PLAYERNAME%!  And...would you keep the light on in the lab for me? All this spooky research is making my hair stand on end.
Wow, %PLAYERNAME%! It seems we’ve had a spooky brush with Spiritomb!
I can’t tell if it’s the weather, but I’ve got the shivers! You know, I feel confident that we can solve anything together, %PLAYERNAME%, even when things get scary.
I'll be in touch soon!
Hello, %PLAYERNAME%! It’s great to see you! Can you guess what else I saw earlier while walking through the forest? Fountains of water, coming out of a river!
At first, I wondered who would install a fountain in the middle of nature.
But then, I saw beautiful auburn between the spouts of water, and realized our mystery architect must be a Squirtle!
Squirtle hide in their shells to protect themselves, then strike back with spouts of water at every opportunity. That must've been what I saw!
Squirtle’s also well known as a Pokémon that aspiring Trainers from the Kanto region can choose to be their first partner Pokémon.
Why don’t you have a look at the Tiny Turtle Pokémon yourself, %PLAYERNAME%? 
Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! While you were getting up and close with Squirtle, I happened upon a Wartortle with algae growing out of its shell!
Wartortle is Squirtle's evolution. Ones with algae on their shells are very old, so imagine what that Wartortle’s seen in its years!
Why don’t you evolve one of your Squirtle, %PLAYERNAME%? It’ll be able to keep you company for a good long while.
Great work, %PLAYERNAME%! I wasn’t exaggerating when I said Wartortle could keep you company for a long time. Maybe even longer than me!
Wartortle are said to live 10,000 years. Their furry tails are popular as a symbol of longevity.
Their tails become increasingly deeper in color as they age. Isn’t that fascinating? It’s the exact opposite of us humans!
And Wartortle doesn’t just have incredible endurance—they can also grow to become even stronger. When they evolve into Blastoise, they grow rocket cannons on their shells!
If you evolve a Wartortle, you can see it for yourself, %PLAYERNAME%! 
Look at the rocket cannons on that Blastoise, %PLAYERNAME%! As you can see, Blastoise has spouts extending from its shell at the top.
Once Blastoise takes aim at an enemy, it can blast out water with even more force than a fire hose.
Now that might be a fun way to cool down during a scorching summer, eh?
Blastoise would just have to be mindful of its own power—some researchers even say the jets of water Blastoise spouts from the rocket cannons on its shell can punch through thick steel!
But with a Trainer like you, I’m sure everything will be under control, whether you and your Blastoise are out for some summer fun, or engaged in a fierce battle!
And speaking of summer fun, I’ve got to run and get the inflatable pool out for Meltan. Thanks for spending the day with me, %PLAYERNAME%. I’ll see you again soon! 
Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! You surprised me, much like the Seedot that just fell from that tree over there.
It really scared a Pidgey that was foraging nearby, and I’m pretty sure it did that on purpose.
It’s easy for Seedot to trick people and Pokémon alike because Seedot are almost indistinguishable from acorns.
Are they appearing in higher numbers right now, or am I seeing double? Could you help me investigate this nutty situation?
Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! While you were away, I was just refreshing my memory on Seedot.
Apparently, it attaches itself to a tree branch using the top of its head and sucks moisture from the tree it’s hanging from. The more water Seedot drinks, the glossier its body becomes.
Thanks, Seedot, for reminding us to stay hydrated! Did you know that Seedot can evolve? AHHH! Sorry, I was just startled by another one.
Why don’t you try evolving Seedot? Maybe it’ll get calmer and stop playing pranks on everyone!
On the one hand, fantastic work, Trainer. Your little Seedot has evolved into Nuzleaf, the Wily Pokémon. On the other hand, our plan to calm Seedot down by evolving it has backfired.
Apparently, Nuzleaf can make a flute out of the leaf on its head, and the sound of that flute strikes fear and uncertainty into the hearts of people who hear it.
I’m sorry. But I have faith that a brave Trainer like yourself can handle Nuzleaf just fine!
Maybe if we try evolving it again...its next form will be less scary! Personally, I’ve been startled enough for one day of research!
So...your Nuzleaf has evolved into Shiftry, the Wicked Pokémon. Unfortunately, upon reviewing data on Shiftry, I learned it can be quite fearsome, too.
Using its leafy fan, Shiftry can create wind gusts with speeds of up to one hundred feet per second. That’s strong enough to level houses! I think I need to go tie my mobile lab down!
I’d rather be surprised by a Seedot than blown away by a Shiftry! Hah...lesson learned—stay up-to-date with Pokémon, even familiar ones!
Thank you for your help researching this odd occurrence. Once these winds die down, I’ll be in touch about our next research adventure!
Greetings, Pokémon Trainer. You have arrived at a convenient time. I would like you to assist me.
I am only beginning to grow familiar with the sounds of this world. The rustling of leaves, the crashing of waves...
But today I hear a new—there!
That high-pitched chattering and stirring of air. Is it some sort of natural phenomenon?
So you believe it to be caused by Pokémon. Intriguing.
I am eager to locate the source. Let us proceed.
So the multitude of Starly are the source of this cacophony.
Though diminutive, they flap their wings with great power. And when they form a flock...
I would not wish to be the target of their displeasure.
The strength of such a small creature is a marvel.
And if it were to evolve, I suspect that strength would only grow.
Evolution affects Pokémon in such splendid ways. How will Starly change, do you think? Not another head, surely?
After our experience with Deino, little would surprise me. Nevertheless, I would like to witness this transformation for myself.
I am impressed yet again, Pokémon Trainer.
Staravia might not have grown an additional head, but it did increase in size.
My early observations indicate that Staravia, too, prefer to travel in a flock.
And when Staravia are not surrounded by their kind, they cry noisily. Perhaps they find comfort and security when together.
I...can understand this.
Ahem. Does it evolve further? What changes might that bring?
Stunning. What a formidable physique.
This musculature of this Pokémon—Staraptor, is it?—indicates great strength. It appears more than capable of carrying away its prey.
And, unlike Starly and Staravia, it appears not to travel in flocks. Curious.
The Pokémon of this world have such fascinating social structures. Some are more comfortable with others, and some find contentment alone.
They are like humans in this way, do you not think?
With each investigation we undertake, my understanding of your world is further illuminated.
Thank you for your company, Pokémon Trainer. Until again.
*yawn* Hello, %PLAYERNAME%... You’ll have to forgive my appearance, I was up late last night studying some nearby Rowlet. For as sleepy as they can be during the day, they sure perk right up at night!
Maybe it’d help me relax if I had a soft, cute Pokémon to hug... Like Stufful!
Stufful has an adorable appearance, but it hates to be hugged or touched in any way. Which is a shame because I’ve heard its fur is a delight to pet!
I wonder if I’ll ever get the chance to snuggle one—for science, of course! Maybe you could bring me a Stufful, %PLAYERNAME%? Just to look at!
%PLAYERNAME%, you’re back! And you’ve brought a Stufful with you! It looks so soft and fluffy...
Er-hem! Despite their looks, Stufful are incredibly dangerous Pokémon. A touch from anyone except a known friend sends Stufful into a surging frenzy!
For both our sakes, maybe we’d better befriend it before we try to cuddle—I mean, continue our research, don’t you think? Why not try feeding Stufful a Berry or two, %PLAYERNAME%. Perhaps we can get closer to it that way.
Your Stufful seems friendlier already, %PLAYERNAME%! Speaking of friendly, have you heard that its Evolution—Bewear—has the habit of hugging its companions?
Once Bewear accepts you as a friend, it tries to show its affection with a hug. But letting it do that is dangerous—it could easily shatter your bones!
Many Trainers have left this world after their spines were squashed by its hug...
While I don’t recommend you go hugging a Bewear anytime soon, there isn’t any harm in trying to meet one! Why don’t you evolve Stufful, %PLAYERNAME%?
What a strong-looking Bewear you’ve come back with, %PLAYERNAME%!
What’s that? You say I look a bit more frazzled than usual? Well...I may have tried to pet Stufful while you were away, and its flailing sent me flying so far someone could’ve mistaken me for a bird Pokémon. Haha—ow...
On the bright side, I did get to both pet Stufful and experience its strength firsthand! Come to think of it, I have a colleague studying Pokémon moves who’d love to hear all about this...
I hope you’ve had more luck bonding with your new Stufful and Bewear companions, %PLAYERNAME%. I think I’m going to bow out and grab an ice pack...or six. Thanks for all your help today! Take care, I’ll be in touch!
Hello there, %PLAYERNAME%! I was just taking a moment to admire the weather here. Blue skies abound, with the fluffiest of clouds floating by.
I’d love to just kick back and enjoy the tranquility of it all, but I’ve observed some of the clouds moving rather...strangely.
Believe it or not, I believe some of them are actually flapping—yes, like birds!
The first few times I saw it, I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me, but as the motions grew more frequent, I began to suspect a Pokémon was involved.
Mind going on a little jaunt to see what you can discover?
Welcome back, Trainer! What have you discovered?
Ah—Swablu! The Cotton Bird Pokémon. Hmm... It’s all beginning to make sense.
Swablu’s cotton-like wings are so fluffy and white that, alongside their sky-blue bodies, Swablu can be easily mistaken for clouds in the sky.
At least until you catch them flapping, eh? Haha!
Swablu apparently love to sit on people’s heads. They look like fluffy hats!
Ah, and there it goes! Right on your head. Good timing, Swablu!
Fond as they are of their human perches, Swablu will take flight right away if their wings get dirty. Cleanliness begets comfort, after all.
A fascinating Pokémon through and through, don’t you think?
Evolving Swablu takes some effort, but I assure you—it’s well worth it! I’m sure a Trainer of your talent could gather the necessary Candy in no time.
I’d love to see its Evolution in person, so could you evolve your Swablu for me? Be sure to use Pinap Berries to earn even more Candy!
Incredible work, %PLAYERNAME%! Looks like you’ve been hard at work catching Swablu.
Evolving Swablu is truly an act of patience, isn’t it?
Patience is often called a virtue in a broad sense, but it really is an integral part of being a great Trainer.
As the saying goes: good things come to those who wait!
All your hard work will feel justified once you witness your darling Swablu evolve. Of that, you have my word!
Just one more leg of this journey left to go, %PLAYERNAME%. Let's go!
Welcome back, Trainer! I see your efforts have paid off. Well done!
Swablu’s Evolution, Altaria, is called the Humming Pokémon.
It’s known to wrap its wings around the people it’s bonded with—much like yours is doing with you now.
And humming all the while! You know, people say that Altaria’s humming could enrapture an entire audience with its beauty, and it’s not hard to see why.
Between Altaria’s song and your remarkable bond, I have to say I’m feeling quite moved!
You truly are an incredible Trainer.
Thanks for your help on this latest adventure, %PLAYERNAME%. I’ll never get tired of learning more about Pokémon!
Now, let’s GO!
Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%!
Have you noticed all the Swinub out today? I wonder if there’s something they find enticing buried around here.
After all, Swinub rub their snouts on the ground to find and dig up food. Their favorite food is mushrooms that grow under dead grass.
In fact, in ancient times, the people of Hisui relied on this skill.
Best we don’t interrupt any Swinub mid-snuffle, but we can still spend some time observing them.
You’re right, some mushroom soup does sound good, Meltan—
Ah, %PLAYERNAME%! Welcome back! Though I should’ve heard you coming with those sniffing Swinub behind you.
Swinub’s Evolution, Piloswine, also has a sensitive nose. And their thick coat of long hair helps them endure freezing cold.
Sounds cozy, doesn’t it? Maybe I should take a hint and grow my beard out during the winter months...
Ahem. You’re right—I’m sure their hair is different from mine. The cold is nothing a good parka can’t fix, anyway!
Let’s have a look at Piloswine in person.
Is that a walking coat or a Piloswine, %PLAYERNAME%?
Aw, not even a chuckle? I didn’t expect my joke to get such a chilly reception! Haha.
I’ll make it up to you with a cool fact—Piloswine’s Evolution, Mamoswine, has tusks made of ice! As the weather grows colder, its ice tusks grow longer, thicker, and more impressive.
What do you think Mamoswine’s tusks will look like on a day like this?
Great work, %PLAYERNAME%! Mamoswine’s tusks really are impressive!
It’s hard to imagine anything could get the better of a Pokémon this sturdy. In fact, this Pokémon has been around a long, looong time.
I recently read that a frozen Mamoswine was dug up from soil dating back 10,000 years ago. And it woke up, to my amazement!
In a way, seeing a Mamoswine today is like looking back in time.
What other Pokémon that we see today were also around then? How have they changed?
All fascinating questions that require further research to answer. But what we’ve observed of Swinub, Piloswine, and Mamoswine today is a great start.
Think on it as you go about the rest of your day, and come back soon to tell me your theories! But until then, thanks for spending the day with me.
Let’s GO!
Hi there, %PLAYERNAME%. I can’t help but be impressed by your progress. You’ve done fantastic work in researching Pokémon originally discovered in the Kanto, Johto, Hoenn, and Sinnoh regions.
Now that we’ve researched Pokémon that were found in those regions...
let’s take a closer look at Pokémon originally discovered in the Unova region!
I think it’s fascinating that even though we know a lot about Pokémon from all over the world, there’s always more to learn!
Speaking of discoveries, I’ve been doing some additional research and heard about an interesting phenomenon that has to do with Meowth in the Galar region.
I was speaking to a researcher who’s the granddaughter of a colleague from Galar, and she shared some intriguing information.
It seems that Galarian Meowth lived with seafaring people, which toughened their bodies so much that parts of them turned to iron.
Maybe I could get a few workout tips—I’ve been looking for some ways to toughen up myself!
Anyway...let’s do some more research on Pokémon originally discovered in Unova, but be sure to keep your eyes open for other exciting discoveries.
Wonderful work, Trainer. You might be familiar with the tradition in which a Pokémon Trainer selects their very first partner from a group of three Pokémon.
These first-partner Pokémon are normally Fire, Water, or Grass types. In Unova, many Trainers choose the Water-type Oshawott as their first-partner Pokémon.
This Sea Otter Pokémon is known to use the scalchop on its stomach during battle. Isn’t that just adorable? Please continue your research, and let me know your findings.
I can’t stop thinking about how cute Oshawott is... Oh! You’re back! Excellent work catching that Darumaka!
Now that we’ve researched the Water-type first-partner Pokémon of many Trainers from Unova, let’s shift focus to the Fire-type one—Tepig!
I’m a particular fan of Tepig because it uses the fireballs that come from its nose to roast Berries. It’s such a clever use of a skill.
I just love roasted Pinap Berries! We should continue our work and see what else we can discover.
Being the savvy Trainer you are, I’m sure you know which type of Pokémon we’re going to research next.
That’s right—Grass type! In Unova, many Trainers choose the Grass Snake Pokémon Snivy as their first partner. Snivy is intelligent and calm, and being exposed to lots of sunlight makes it move more swiftly.
Perhaps there’s a lot we could learn from such a sagacious Pokémon!
Anyway, let’s get started on these research tasks. Be sure to listen carefully, as you never know what you might encounter!
You’re a natural, %PLAYERNAME%. I’m so glad we could research some of the amazing Pokémon originally discovered in the Unova region.
I can’t thank you enough for your hard work. I hope you put this Charged TM and Fast TM to good use!
By the way, I literally stumbled across a mysterious Pokémon I’ve never encountered before.
I think you’re the perfect Trainer to take this Pokémon and help it reach its potential. Best of luck, and I’ll be in touch soon!
Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! Glad to see you.
I was just thinking that it’d be interesting to research more about my Buddy Pokémon and the team leaders’ buddies.
The four of us have powerful bonds with our buddies. Blanche has formed a wonderful relationship with Lapras, Candela has had Rapidash since it was a Ponyta, and Spark has developed an electrifying bond with Elekid.
My buddy is the Mythical Pokémon Meltan. Since Meltan and I met, I’ve been documenting everything I learn about it. And trust me—there’s a lot to learn!
I’ve actually heard some reports of Meltan sightings recently. Maybe you’ll run into one on your adventures?
Definitely something to keep an eye out for as we begin our research. But first, let’s stock up on some supplies!
Welcome back, Trainer! Seems like you’re all set to head out on this research adventure. Why don’t we start by looking at the cool pair that is Blanche and Lapras?
Known as the Transport Pokémon, Lapras is both Water- and Ice-type. A smart and kindhearted Pokémon, it glides across the surface of the sea while its beautiful song echoes around it.
Lapras are known to have gentle hearts and can even understand human speech. I completely understand why Blanche chose Lapras as a buddy.
That said, Blanche clearly feels a special connection to Lapras.
Blanche got Lapras by trading with a fellow Team Mystic Trainer. I wonder if that has something to do with it.
At any rate, let’s focus our research on Water- and Ice-type Pokémon to learn more about the Pokémon that Blanche holds dear.
Excellent work, %PLAYERNAME%. It looks like you have your very own Lapras, just like Blanche!
Be sure to tell your Lapras I said hi! I never miss a chance to greet new Pokémon. Now, let’s move on to our next dynamic duo: Spark and Elekid.
The leader of Team Instinct has always had a soft spot for Pokémon that hatch from Eggs, so it’s only natural that he’d have a buddy like Elekid.
But don’t let this Pokémon’s small stature fool you! Spark’s Elekid is incredibly powerful, making it a fitting buddy for the energetic team leader.
Why hasn’t Spark evolved his Elekid? Well, Evolution should be approached with care.
I’m sure Spark will know when Elekid is ready to evolve.
Spark may seem pretty carefree, but few are more committed to the care and training of Pokémon than him.
What do you say we research some Electric-type Pokémon that Spark tends to work with?
How did your research go, Trainer? I think it’s time to turn our attention to some Fire-type Pokémon—specifically the Fire Horse Pokémon Rapidash.
This Pokémon has a competitive streak, making it a great match for Candela, the leader of Team Valor.
Candela has had her Rapidash since it was a Ponyta, so you can be sure the two of them have been on more than a few adventures.
Rapidash loves to run and gallop, so Candela always makes sure her Buddy Pokémon has plenty of time and space to do just that.
That kind of care is critical for building strong, lasting relationships with your Pokémon.
Candela’s passion and dedication make her a great role model for her fellow Team Valor members—and everyone, really.
Maybe researching Fire-type Pokémon will help you learn more about Candela’s fiery spirit?
Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! Thanks for conducting that research on Fire-type Pokémon.
Now that we’ve learned more about the Pokémon that Blanche, Spark, and Candela call their buddies, it’s time to do some research on my Buddy Pokémon: Meltan.
I remember when I first met my Meltan. I was out doing some research when I stumbled upon a group of them. I’d never seen a Pokémon like it before, and I wanted to share my findings with my mentor, Professor Oak.
The group of Meltan eventually departed, but one Meltan stuck around, and we’ve been together ever since!
At first, I assumed Meltan only stayed to snack on all the metal knickknacks in my mobile lab. But as time passed, our bond grew stronger, and now we’re practically inseparable.
Our favorite thing is to go on long walks and look for metallic snacks for Meltan. Which reminds me—we still need to look into those reports of Meltan appearing nearby!
Let’s do some investigating and see if we can find any Meltan, Trainer!
Well done, Trainer! Thanks to your hard work, you have your very own Meltan!
I’m sure that if you take the time to build up your relationship, Meltan will evolve into Melmetal in no time!
Melmetal stands over eight feet tall. By using centrifugal force, Melmetal can use its heavy hex-nut arms to deliver the strongest punches of all Pokémon.
But I’m getting ahead of myself. Now is the time to focus on the friendship between you and your Buddy Pokémon—whether it be Meltan or any other Pokémon that you feel a special bond with.
After studying the bonds the team leaders and I have with our Buddy Pokémon, I hope you feel inspired to find a buddy you can grow with as well.
I’ve no doubt you and your Buddy Pokémon will achieve some incredible things—and Meltan and I will be cheering you on!
Thank again for your assistance. Until next time, let’s GO!
Hey, %PLAYERNAME%! Good to see you again!
You know, I thought I smelled something sweet in the air today.
Did I spill Berry juice again, you ask? You wound me, %PLAYERNAME%! As if I’d ruin this snazzy new jacket!
Heh. In all seriousness, the smell was coming from outside.
Unfortunately, I didn’t have a chance to track down the source of the scent. But now that you’re here, maybe you can sniff it out!
Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%. Seeing as you’ve got Teddiursa with you, I think I can connect the dots on what I was smelling earlier—honey!
Teddiursa likes to lick its palms after soaking them in honey, so it’s no wonder I caught a whiff.
That reminds me of a fun fact about Teddiursa’s Evolution, Ursaring.
With its ability to distinguish any aroma, Ursaring unfailingly finds all food buried deep underground. If only it was that easy for me to find lunch!
Why don’t you help Teddiursa evolve so you can see Ursaring’s sleuthing skills for yourself, %PLAYERNAME%?
I thought I heard something stomping about, and here you are, Ursaring in tow!
Here’s the thing about Ursaring—although it has a large body, it’s quite skilled at climbing trees. It eats and sleeps in the treetops.
Ah, to be an Ursaring... Imagine how much easier that’d make fieldwork—or picking Pinap Berries!
Ahem. Snacks aside, have you noticed there’s a full moon out early today?
Looks like Ursaring is staring at it, too. Think you can find out why, %PLAYERNAME%?
Whoa! Could that be—Ursaluna?!
I’ve never seen one in these parts. What an incredible find! Hmm...
Maybe in the Hisui region of long ago, where Ursaluna was first discovered, the full moon played a part in how Ursaring evolved.
It’s theorized that Hisui's swampy terrain gave Ursaluna its burly physique and ability to manipulate peat at will.
What kind of food would suit a Pokémon accustomed to living in swamps? Grains? Beans? Cake?
Maybe I should get baking for some firsthand taste-testing. I bet Teddiursa could lend me some honey!
Ah—listen to me yammering on and on. Researching Pokémon first found in Hisui never fails to pique my curiosity about the past!
Thanks again for spending the day learning about Pokémon with me, %PLAYERNAME%. I can always count on you to make my work a little sweeter!
Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! Good to see you. Do you have anything fun planned for today?
I’ll be attending a picnic with the team leaders, myself.
I must say, though, I was having a pretty hard time deciding what I should bring. Candela’s in charge of sandwiches, Spark is handling refreshments, and Blanche is bringing shaved ice, so the bases are all pretty well covered.
Walking always clears my head, so I took a stroll and ended up spotting a large group of Tepig near where I normally pick my go-to snack, Pinap Berries.
And suddenly—inspiration! Did you know Tepig loves to eat roasted Berries, Trainer?
The Fire Pig Pokémon blows fire balls through its nose and roasts the berries before it eats them.
Roasted Berries sound like a great picnic snack, don’t you think? And speaking of, I need to start getting them ready. Why don’t you go check out the Tepig in the meantime?
Welcome back, Trainer.
Ah, I see you’ve caught a Tepig of your own! They make terrific companions in all aspects of life.
Tepig evolves into Pignite, which, like Tepig, is known as the Fire Pig Pokémon.
When Pignite’s internal fire flares up, its movements grow sharper and faster. Whatever it eats becomes fuel for the flame in its stomach. Must do wonders for digestion!
Oh! That reminds me—I need to check on my roasted Berries.
While I finish up my picnic preparations, why don’t you see about evolving your Tepig into Pignite?
Hello again, %PLAYERNAME%. The Berry-roasting process is going swimmingly, and the whole place smells delicious!
Just when I thought Pokémon couldn’t inspire me any more than they already do, here I am taking cooking tips from Tepig. Haha!
Nice Pignite, by the way! Very round. Did you know that Pignite can evolve? Its Evolution is a Pokémon called Emboar.
Emboar is known to heat up its punches by setting its fists ablaze with its fiery chin. It’s also known to care deeply about its friends.
Speaking of friends, I should let the team leaders know that I’ll be on my way soon.
How about evolving your Pignite into Emboar, Trainer? I’d love to see its fiery beard firsthand.
Fantastic work, %PLAYERNAME%! Your Emboar is truly a sight to see!
This powerful Fire- and Fighting-type Pokémon is known as the Mega Fire Pig Pokémon.
According to my research, Emboar is a master of fast and powerful Fighting-type attacks.
And wow... Look at that beard of fire. What do you think, Trainer? Could you see me with one of those?
Haha, only joking! I’m sure I’d find it far too itchy.
Anyway, I should let you get back to exploring. And I should get to that picnic!
Have a wonderful weekend, and keep up all the hard work. It’s always a joy to see how much you’ve grown as a Trainer each time we meet.
I’ll be in touch soon with some more research opportunities. Or who knows—maybe even some recipes!
Now, let’s GO!
There you are! I had a feeling I’d see you today, %PLAYERNAME%.
Look at all the Togetic fluttering around. I’ve never seen so many at once!
Togetic is said to be a Pokémon that brings good fortune, and what better fortune could I have than running into you?
Let’s see what other good things lie in store for us as we continue observing these Togetic.
Your Togetic is positively glowing, %PLAYERNAME%! Could that glow be from Togetic’s distinctive joy dust?
You see, research says that Togetic appear in front of kindly people to scatter a glowing down called “joy dust,” showering them with happiness.
What practical applications could there be for joy dust? Will Pokémon and humans feel joy upon seeing it?
We researchers have yet to answer these questions. Just thinking of the possibilities is filling me with happiness!
But first things first. A kindhearted Trainer—or Professor—doesn’t forget to take care of Pokémon.
Let’s share some happiness with Togetic by feeding them some Berries, %PLAYERNAME%!
Nice work, %PLAYERNAME%. Those Togetic look positively jubilant.
Speaking of being jubilant, let me tell you about Togetic’s Evolution, Togekiss! It’s also known as the Jubilee Pokémon.
Togekiss share their many blessings with people who respect one another’s rights and avoid needless strife. It sounds like quite the wonderful Pokémon to have around.
I bet you’d have no trouble evolving Togetic into a Togekiss of your own. Why not give it a try?
Amazing, %PLAYERNAME%! You’ve evolved Togetic into your very own Togekiss!
These Pokémon are never seen anywhere near conflict or turmoil. It’s been depicted on good-luck charms since ancient times.
Speaking of bygone times, a researcher from long ago wrote, “After studying what literature remains, I am certain Togekiss will reveal itself when peace reigns over the land.”
I know I’m filled with peace and happiness whenever you reveal yourself to help with my research.
Thanks for spending another day with me, %PLAYERNAME%. Until next time, let’s GO!
Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%!
Your timing is excellent. I’ve hit a bit of a roadblock in my research!
You see, I’m still puzzling over the guardian deities both Spark and Blanche have seen recently. I’ve yet to suss out why they’ve been appearing.
I can only hope they’re not angry with us—or worse!
I think I’ll take a break in the shade to clear my mind. It’s important to give your brain a breather now and then!
Why don’t you head out to find some shade for yourself, %PLAYERNAME%?
Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! I see you’ve found some leafy Pokémon to rest under.
Are you feeling refreshed? I know I am!
While you were out, I thought of a new angle for our investigation.
As you may know, Alola is home to four guardian deities. We’ve seen two, so it stands to reason the other two may be buzzing about already.
Instead of waiting for them to come to us, I think we should get out and search for them ourselves.
Let’s start with Tapu Bulu, guardian deity of Ula’Ula Island.
Ula’Ula Island is a rugged locale, home to Mount Lanakila, the highest peak in Alola.
Tapu Bulu is said to make ringing sounds with its tail to let others know where it is and avoid unneeded conflicts. Knowing that, it shouldn’t be too hard to find!
In addition, I know Tapu Bulu can help plants grow, so perhaps we’ll have some luck if we begin by looking for Pokémon that are known to grow. Let’s get out there, %PLAYERNAME%!
Ah, %PLAYERNAME%—you’re back. How did your search go?
I asked Candela to lend us a hand shortly after you left.
And just a few minutes later, before I’d even finished packing my gear, she came running back saying she’d heard a ringing in the air and looked up to see Tapu Bulu floating by!
Yet another guardian deity I’ve missed by a hair... Such is the fickle nature of Pokémon research, I suppose.
I’m glad you’ve at least been more successful, %PLAYERNAME%. Now that we know it’s out there, let’s double down on our search for Tapu Bulu!
I’ll speak with Candela to see if she might know any more details that could help us.
%PLAYERNAME%—you saw Tapu Bulu, didn’t you!
What was it like? Tell me everything! Did you hear a ringing noise? Did you see it making vegetation grow, or maybe even swinging large trees around by their roots?
Those are all things Tapu Bulu is known for, you know.
As you might’ve expected, I was—yet again—unable to witness Tapu Bulu myself. I did, however, think up a new theory.
The guardian deities seem to be keeping a relatively low profile. Perhaps they’re just here to investigate something—or even help us somehow.
Things may become clearer if we see Tapu Fini, the last of Alola’s guardian deities.
For now, though, I think we’ve earned some rest. See you next time, %PLAYERNAME%!
Good to see you, %PLAYERNAME%!
What a lovely day! But it looks like there’s pollen in the ah...ah...ah-choo!
Shame it’s garden-variety pollen and not healing pollen from the Flabébé I’ve seen around.
I wish I were as carefree as the Flabébé seem to be! With their untroubled hearts, I wonder what Flabébé wish for...
Sorry, I got lost in my daydreams! What about you, %PLAYERNAME%? What’s your research wish today?
Brrr... Ah! %PLAYERNAME%! Did you notice the snow we’ve been getting? It’s beautiful—and freezing! I feel colder than a Bergmite!
Winter is a time for wishing, and while a Bergmite might wish for the weather to stay like this forever, I’m wishing for an extra layer!
What about you, %PLAYERNAME%? What’s your winter research wish?
Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! I stepped out of my mobile lab this morning only to see needlelike horns poking out of the grass all around me.
Luckily, I also saw big red noses poking out of the grass and realized they belonged to Weedle, the Hairy Bug Pokémon. I guess you could say we’re in a...hairy situation!
...Uh, moving along...
Weedle’s horn measures about two inches. It’s a sharp stinger that can inject poison!
Let’s investigate Weedle further—but watch your step! There are Weedle everywhere, and you wouldn’t want to get poked by one.
Nice footwork, Trainer. I read a fascinating tidbit while you were conducting your research—Weedle has an extremely acute sense of smell.
It finds its favorite kinds of leaves by sniffing them out with its big, red, and—in my opinion—honkable nose.
I can think of a number of times this useful skill would come in handy, like when the team leaders start sharing snacks around the lab and don’t think to offer me any.
Anyway, I think that we should look further into Weedle’s Evolution. I can’t wait to see what other fascinating details we learn.
Well done with that evolving, %PLAYERNAME%. However, it looks like the evolved form of Weedle, Kakuna, is just...sitting there. I knew this Cocoon Pokémon didn’t move much, but wow.
Seeing it in person has made me realize that...it really does just sit there. But while it seems like it’s doing nothing, it’s actually extremely busy preparing for its upcoming Evolution.
And that’s evident by how hot to the touch the shell becomes! Isn’t that exciting? Thanks to our research, we’ve learned so much about what’s happening to Kakuna!
Let’s keep going! I think that Kakuna of yours is almost ready to show you what it’s been working on.
Thanks to its hard work, Kakuna has evolved into Beedrill! It now has three poisonous stingers and wings that allow it to fly quickly. Talk about a glow-up!
Beedrill, the Poison Bee Pokémon, is known for being extremely territorial. It sometimes attacks in swarms, and Beedrill nests are very dangerous!
This powerful Bug- and Poison-type Pokémon may surprise you in Trainer Battles, too.
Thanks for your help today, %PLAYERNAME%. I’ll be in touch once I figure out how to maneuver my mobile lab out of this area. I wouldn’t want a Weedle poking a hole in one of the mobile lab’s tires!
%PLAYERNAME%! Thank goodness you made it to this important research site.
I came to study Pokémon that commonly appear in this area, but it seems I need your help! The species of Pokémon I’ve observed today don’t normally appear around here. What a strange occurrence!
Would you be willing to travel throughout the park and perform some tasks for me? With all these wild Pokémon around, it almost feels like a safari!
Please complete the following research tasks: {0}{1}{2}{3}{4}
Wow, great work today! In addition to completing some insightful research, you’ve skillfully helped me document the amazing nature around us and the fascinating migration patterns that Pokémon follow. I have a feeling there’s even more to discover out here!
The results of your work have produced an awesome amount of Stardust. Perhaps you could find good use for it in powering up or trading a Pokémon! Enjoy, %PLAYERNAME%!
What peculiar coloring. Is it an aberration, or—?
Ah. You have arrived at an opportune moment, Pokémon Trainer. Might I seek your insight?
Zigzagoon are present in vast numbers today, but they are notably different from those I have observed previously.
Zigzagoon’s fur is normally earthy in hue, but these Zigzagoon are black and white.
Can you explain this?
I see... These Zigzagoon were first discovered in the Galar region.
So a single Pokémon species can develop differently based on its habitat? Fascinating.
I will spend today observing these Galarian Zigzagoon. Will you assist me, Pokémon Trainer?
How energetic these Galarian Zigzagoon are. Have you also observed how they dash in a zigzag pattern?
I hypothesized that this may increase its evasiveness—but when I tested it myself, I grew quite dizzy.
Fret not, Pokémon Trainer—no people or Pokémon were harmed during my experiment.
I am left wondering whether evolution would ease or encourage Galarian Zigzagoon’s frenetic movements. Perhaps we can discover that answer together.
Thank you for your assistance, Pokémon Trainer.
I have concluded that Galarian Linoone’s disposition is no calmer than Galarian Zigzagoon’s. Indeed, its aggression appears to have increased.
Not long before your arrival, I observed a group of Galarian Linoone using their long tongues to taunt other Pokémon.
They then hurled themselves at their enraged foes.
I am continuously enthralled by the ways Pokémon interact with each other.
Might Galarian Linoone itself be capable of evolution? More research is required.
Greetings, Pokémon Trainer. You have brought me...Obstagoon, is it?
Unlike Galarian Linoone, Obstagoon stands on two legs. I surmise this is to establish a threatening posture.
What’s more, I witnessed firsthand its ability to make staggering vocal outbursts.
My heart has yet to return to its normal rhythm.
I find it remarkable that the assertive Obstagoon was once a diminutive Galarian Zigzagoon.
How must it feel to experience such profound transformation? I assume your Professor Willow would have some insight.
This has been a valuable learning experience. Thank you for your assistance today, Pokémon Trainer.

Ah, %PLAYERNAME%! Good to see you!
There’s a lot to do this summer! New things to experience—new Pokémon to find!
Let’s start with a few simple tasks to help you get your bearings.
Wow, is that a Dratini you’ve found? That’s quite a rare Pokémon!
I can tell this Dratini has the potential to become a close friend of yours! Why don’t you two take some time to get to know each other?
Impressive! Dragonair is a powerful Pokémon in its own right. Let’s get Dragonair ready to battle!
You can try taking on other Trainers or working together to take down huge Raid Bosses!
Nice work! You and your Pokémon make a great team!
There are many new kinds of Pokémon that have started appearing recently in the world.
You should take a look and see if you can find anything new.
Amazing! You found some rare Pokémon that were first discovered in the Sinnoh region already? And is that...a Shiny Pokémon?
Amazing! I’ve never seen an Eevee like that before! Shiny Pokémon have a rare and distinct coloration that sets them apart from others of their species!
Let’s commemorate this moment! Why don’t you take a snapshot and celebrate with friends?
Wow, a wild Lapras sought you out?
Looks like you’re going to do great this summer!
They say Trainers and Pokémon are most powerful when they band together.
Good luck! It’s time to GO!

This is probably a waste of my time, but I do love winning!
This won’t be all bad—when you lose, you’ll at least get to hear me say you made a good effort.
I won’t be surprised when I win.
It will be good for you to see a true Trainer like me in battle.
If you are as weak as your team leaders, then this fight will be easy.
You should probably take notes, dear.
I’ll never pass up an opportunity to show off on the battlefield!
Can we move this along? I’d love to stay and chat, but I have a meeting to get to.
You shouldn’t get in my way. You might get hurt, dear.
This is a challenge you should walk away from, dear.
I’ve lost my touch... But it will not happen again.
I underestimated you, but I will not make the same mistake again.
I can’t lose... What does this mean?
You win this time, but things’ll go differently next time we meet!
Ugh, these Pokémon are too weak for a Trainer like me!
How amusing! You dare to challenge me?
I’m not fond of dealing with weaklings. Pay attention! You might learn something.
Such an eager Trainer. I’ll happily defeat you.
Your inevitable loss will be such a good lesson.
Pay attention, Trainer. You just might learn something!
I’m getting tired of battling weaklings. Let’s get this over with.
Silly Trainer. You ought to know better than to oppose me.
You’ve had your fun. Now it’s time for you to fight me.
I can see this will be a struggle for you. Don’t worry. I’ll defeat you quickly.
It’s so cute how willing you are to accept your defeat. Let’s battle.
I wish I could enjoy this victory, but it wasn’t a surprise!
...Oh? You’re still here?
Move along, dear. Team GO Rocket always wins.
How...simple.
Come back when you can actually pose a challenge, dear!

That was an amazing battle!
Whoa—not a signal in sight! I wonder what they’re scared of?
Just when I was energized to do some battling! Maybe we should check out other locations.
No signals? Well, it is getting pretty late... and I need to go meet up with Willow.
We might have better luck catching them during the daytime, when Candela and I usually get most of our research done.

I was thinking: Because we don’t know what attracted Shaymin here, we should make sure the surrounding area is safe.
I really hope Shaymin hasn’t found itself in any trouble!
Before we start, though, why don’t you power up some of your Pokémon in case we need to defend Shaymin when we find it?
Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! We’re off to a great start already.
I have another research-related question for you.
How intensely do you think we’ll need to focus our efforts today?
That sounds good to me.
Something else just occurred to me. Do you think Team GO Rocket will try to capture Shaymin?
The thought of something happening to that sweet little Pokémon is almost too much to bear.
Well, now that your team’s powered up, we can stop Team GO Rocket before they even get started. Let’s get out there and scare them off, %PLAYERNAME%!
Welcome back! Thanks for taking care of those Team GO Rocket members.
Now that the area’s safe, we can really focus on our search for Shaymin.
After meeting with the team leaders, I’ve learned that Shaymin sightings are happening around the world! Since we can’t be everywhere all at once, let’s start the search right here, where we are.
Hm? You didn’t know the team leaders were assisting us? But of course!
The team leaders are a curious bunch, and dutiful, too. They’re more than happy to help investigate the mysteries of Pokémon.
My current theory is that Shaymin will appear wherever Trainers are feeling thankful. With that in mind, why don’t you and your Buddy Pokémon try challenging a raid?
Perhaps Shaymin will sense the gratitude you feel for your Pokémon and the other Trainers battling at your side.
Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! How’d it go?
No sign of Shaymin yet, eh? Not to worry. What fun would life be if we got everything on the first try?
I’ll check in with the team leaders to see if they have any new intel. In the meantime, let’s think of other ways we can encourage Shaymin to appear.
What if you try battling some other Trainers? Perhaps Shaymin will sense the bonds of gratitude between you and your Pokémon team. Give it a try, %PLAYERNAME%!
Before we get started, let’s take a moment to appreciate our Pokémon pals.
It’s always exciting to meet new Pokémon, but it’s important to make time for the ones that have supported us all along. After all, we’d be lost without them!
Much like I’d be lost without your unwavering support. Thanks as always, %PLAYERNAME%!
Now, why don’t you spend some time with your Buddy Pokémon?
And I hope you had a pleasant time with your Buddy Pokémon!
Hm? You didn’t know the team leaders were assisting us? But of course! They’re a curious bunch, and dutiful, too. They’re more than happy to help investigate the mysteries of Pokémon.
I wonder if Shaymin is out getting to know the nearby Pokémon. Try catching a few and see if you can spot Shaymin!
Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! How’d it go?
No sign of Shaymin yet, eh? Well, that’s understandable. Mythical Pokémon aren’t known to be easy to find, after all!
I appreciate you entertaining my hypothesis, though. Perhaps we can try luring Shaymin out with some Pinap Berries next? That would certainly work for me... Haha!
Welcome back! No Shaymin yet, eh? Not to worry. What fun would life be if everything came easily?
I’ll check in with the team leaders to see if they have any new info.
While we gather more intel, why don’t you head back out and see what Pokémon you can find?
I’m sure you’re raring to go, but let’s take a moment to think about the friends who’ve helped you on your journey thus far.
Why don’t you send them some Gifts to let them know you’re thinking about them? It’s a great way to show your appreciation!
I hope you know how much I appreciate all you’ve done to help me, %PLAYERNAME%. I really don’t know what I’d do without you!
How intensely do you think we’ll need to focus our efforts today?
Hm? You didn’t know the team leaders were assisting us? But of course!
The team leaders are a curious bunch, and dutiful, too. They’re more than happy to help investigate the mysteries of Pokémon.
Why don’t you visit some interesting locations that are nearby, %PLAYERNAME%? Maybe they’ll have caught Shaymin’s eye!
How’d it go, %PLAYERNAME%?
No sign of Shaymin yet, eh? Well, that’s understandable. Mythical Pokémon aren’t known to be easy to find, after all!
Hmm... Shaymin is known as the Gratitude Pokémon, so perhaps we can attract it to us by expressing gratitude.
It’s just a theory, but maybe hatching an Egg would help? It can’t hurt to try!
Good to see you back, %PLAYERNAME%!
I can tell from your expression that you haven’t encountered Shaymin yet—but try not to worry.
After all, what fun would life be if everything came easily?
While we gather more intel, why don’t you head back out and see what you can find?
%PLAYERNAME%, I have some great news!
I’m hearing reports that Shaymin has been seen nearby!
But unfortunately, I’ve also heard that Team GO Rocket is sneaking around as well. Needless to say, we’ll have to clear them out before they can harm Shaymin.
There’s no time to lose!
Hello, %PLAYERNAME%! Welcome to Pokémon GO Fest 2022.
This year’s festivities are already off to an incredible start—I’m receiving reports that the Mythical Pokémon Shaymin has been sighted nearby!
The flowers on Shaymin’s body are said to burst into bloom when Shaymin is lovingly hugged and senses gratitude. Believe me, it’s not every day you see Shaymin around!
I wonder if Shaymin’s appearance is somehow related to the island guardians...
Or... What if Shaymin’s appeared in response to how thankful I am for all your help lately! Shaymin is known as the Gratitude Pokémon, after all.
I’m also thankful that you’re here today to enjoy the celebrations. You’ve more than earned it!
I’m sure you’re eager to start searching for Shaymin, so I won’t keep you. Something tells me it’s going to be an exciting day!
Now, let’s GO!
Splendid, %PLAYERNAME%—you’ve brought back Shaymin!
Once you’re better friends, I hope you’ll hug it so we can see its flowers burst into bloom!
As always, thanks for helping me with today’s research! Your contributions are truly invaluable.
I’d like to give you a hug myself—but I spilled some Pinap Juice on myself earlier, so I think I’ll keep my stickiness to myself.
I want to hear all about how you found Shaymin, but first—have you noticed what’s appeared in the sky?
Those gaping anomalies appear reminiscent of Hoopa’s rings, but also quite different. A bit like...black holes, perhaps? No—wormholes? What could be on the other side, I wonder? Is this why Alola’s island guardians have been appearing?
My mind is buzzing with all the possibilities! Though, I think we should tackle this tomorrow. Today’s been plenty exciting.
I can’t wait to see what tomorrow holds.
And I’m certain that whatever it is, we’ll face it together!
Thanks again for all your help today, %PLAYERNAME%. And here’s to an exciting tomorrow!
Hello! Looks like you’re already all warmed up.
Before we continue, I’d like your opinion on something very important.
What’s your preferred method of searching for Shaymin?
Great choice, %PLAYERNAME%!
Ah—hello.
Or, hmm... Would “what is up” be an acceptable greeting in this circumstance? I have been told the humans of this world are fond of such parlance.
This world is mysterious. Would you assist me in expanding my knowledge of it?
Thank you. I am fortunate to have found someone so kind.
Tell me all about your world, Pokémon Trainer.
Together, perhaps we can expose why the Ultra Wormholes have materialized in your world and mitigate the anomalies that result.
It is a pleasure to make your acquaintance. I am Rhi of the GO Ultra Recon Squad.
You are a...Pokémon Trainer, is it? I am familiar with the concept.
I apologize if I appear awkward. You are the first human I’ve met in this world.
Do you see that hole in the sky? That is called an Ultra Wormhole, a tear in space that leads to a world very different from yours.
In fact, I’ve traveled through that wormhole myself, in order to research its appearance and assist with any resulting anomalies occurring in your world.
Hm? You have a concern?
I see. This “Professor Willow” failed to appear before you, is it? I’m unfamiliar with any such individual, but I understand the concern that arises when a companion is missing.
I will assist you in your search. In return, however, I would ask a favor.
Wah tee sup, Pokémon Trainer? Hmm... That feels incorrect.
Thank you for your assistance thus far. Shall we turn our attention to other objectives?
Until again, Pokémon Trainer.
First, we must find out what caused the Ultra Wormholes to appear in this world.
Second, we must keep watch for anything that may travel through them.
And third, we must find your missing Willow friend.
But before all of that, a question: what are those large, towering structures spread throughout the area? They seem to sometimes be blue or red or yellow, and they’re far larger than what you said are “PokéStops.”
“Gyms,” is it? And Pokémon Trainers gather there to challenge powerful Pokémon in “Raid Battles”? Fascinating.
Tell me everything you know about these Raid Battles, Pokémon Trainer.
They seem to serve as nexus between powerful creatures and humans.
If it is acceptable to you, I would like to start by focusing our efforts there.
Thank you for shining a light on the concept of Raid Battles, Pokémon Trainer. In return, I will confide in you what I know about the Ultra Wormholes.
Ultra Wormholes are portals into Ultra Space.
But worry not, Pokémon Trainer.
If that person was the Willow professor you’re searching for, the GO Ultra Recon Squad will no doubt come to their aid. Such is our purpose.
In the between time, I will remain here to provide assistance and illuminate any truths I can.
Let us continue to help each other, Pokémon Trainer.
These dimensional passageways allow creatures known as Ultra Beasts to spill into worlds they don’t belong—and they are fiercely strong.
Ultra Beasts are similar to the creatures you call Pokémon—but to your eyes, I imagine they might appear...somewhat different than what you’re accustomed.
As you have likely observed, more and more Ultra Beasts are appearing around you.
The one in your world now is known as UB-01 Symbiont. Certain humans also call it Nihilego.
It is a Rock- and Poison-type Ultra Beast that is thought to produce a strong neurotoxin. It appears to be a parasite that lives by feeding on people and Pokémon.
I’d like to subdue it before it causes trouble for anyone in this world. Can I beg your help in this undertaking?
I have no experience in Pokémon battles. Where I come from, Pokémon are shared.
Furthermore, there are indications that someone from this world was sucked into an Ultra Wormhole. If that is true, that person could be in tremendous danger.
To what are you up, Pokémon Trainer? That...that’s not it, is it? *sigh* I see you have caught many Ground-type Pokémon. May I ask why?
They’re particularly effective against Rock- and Poison-type Pokémon like Nihilego, is it? I see. Your forethought is impressive.
I have decided it would be prudent of me to explore and better familiarize myself with the surrounding area. Would you like to accompany?
We can tell each other more about our worlds as we go.
I am once again thankful to have acquainted myself with someone so cordial.
There is still much for me to learn about this world, but it has been quite exciting thus far.
Come, Pokémon Trainer. Let us see what we can discover together.
A question, Pokémon Trainer—who are those people with the large red Rs on their clothes?
Judging by their dour expressions, I do not believe they’re friends of yours.
Team GO Rocket, is it? Curious...
Their presence unnerves me.
If they intend to cause us problems, may I rely on you?
Your skill in battle is effervescent, Pokémon Trainer! Your aptitude assures me that Nihilego can be safely subdued.
May we now observe the Gyms where Nihilego has been appearing? Participating in Raid Battles may prove illuminating as well.
Hm? Ultra Beasts aren’t the only creatures you’ve encountered of late that are far from their homes?
I see... The Island Guardians of Alola, is it? Perhaps they sensed that the Ultra Wormholes would appear and came to assess how much of a threat they may pose to Alola.
The Alola region... I’ve heard tell of its shine. But we haven’t time for my wistfulness. Let us embark, Pokémon Trainer.
Shall we pause, Pokémon Trainer?
This is my first time in the field with another by my side. I apologize—I’ve yet to grow accustomed to the nuances of this dynamic.
How do you typically enjoy your rest in this world?
I see... Spending time with your Pokémon and friends, hatching Eggs, and other such endeavors, is it?
I am enchanted by these “Incubators” that you place Eggs within.
They seem an amazing feat of human science. Would you provide me a demonstration?
Perhaps if we appear relaxed, Nihilego may respond in kind.
Though there is always a chance it may try to feast upon you—but I will alert you if I notice such behavior in action.
To think I may soon witness Nihilego being captured in a Poké Ball...
You were unfazed by that confrontation with Nihilego.
You seem unafraid of the unknown. It’s an admirable trait.
Do you think Nihilego felt disoriented and alone when it found itself in an unfamiliar world? I feel a kinship with it in that way...
I am lucky to have met a nice human so quickly. I hope Nihilego may also consider itself lucky to have encountered such a kind and accomplished Pokémon Trainer.
In the end, Ultra Beasts are powerful creatures—and not easily controlled.
Once they have arrived in a world, there is little left I can do...
And yet you have managed to take it in gently as if it were any other Pokémon. Selfishly, I wish for a closer look at Nihilego in this state. Do you have a way to observe it safely?
A “snapshot,” is it? What a delight.
Seeing Nihilego in this lucent world, I might even say it is...beautiful?
Your world is almost blindingly bright—and more verdant than I’ve ever experienced. I do hope you and your people take care to preserve its splendor.
Were I to exist in such a sparkling world, I would devote my power to its protection.
Would you mind if we continued our work as partners, Pokémon Trainer?
Our goals easily entwine. Together, we can accomplish and learn much.
You agree? Excellent. Now, our first course of action should be—
Wait. What are these flowers blooming about us? Is this what Pokémon can do? Yours is truly a dazzling world...
Judging by your recent actions, you seem to feel similar. You captured Nihilego, derailing disaster while seeking a solution to this world’s new dilemma.
And regarding your Willow... I recently discovered this juice-stained coat near an Ultra Wormhole. There’s no way to be certain, but it seems highly probable that your Willow is somewhere in Ultra Space.
But worry not, Pokémon Trainer. I will work with you to rescue him. You have done me many favors—it is only fair.
If this man is anything like you’ve described, I have no doubt he’ll be well in the end.
So long as Ultra Wormholes remain open here, we have a chance of his safe return—but Ultra Beasts may also continue to spill into this world.
For now, I’ll see what else I can do to assist you.
The GO Ultra Recon Squad normally works in pairs, and your presence has helped me understand why that is.
In fact...

Hello, %PLAYERNAME%! Are you ready? Your very own Pokémon story is about to unfold. This adventure may be brand new to some, while for others, it might be very familiar.
That’s right—today we’re learning all about the Johto region and meeting some Pokémon originally discovered there, too!
But nothing’s happened yet, so you just focus on having fun with your friends and your Pokémon!
The Johto region is a land steeped in history and tradition, where the bygone beauty of Ecruteak City lies just steps away from the modern metropolis of Goldenrod City.
It’s also the region where Dark- and Steel-type Pokémon were first discovered! Not to mention Mr. Pokémon and the mysterious Mystery Egg.
Speaking of Pokémon originally discovered in the Johto region, I’ve heard tell that Celebi, the Time Travel Pokémon, has been seen nearby.
Celebi has the ability to move through time.
I still can’t shake the feeling that Celebi had something to do with Hisuian Voltorb appearing in our time.
In any case, rumor has it this Celebi knows a special move. I hope we’ll get a chance to see if that’s true!
While you enjoy today’s festivities, keep vigilant for any signs of Team GO Rocket. I know I haven’t forgotten about them.
Hopefully we can get some insight into what they’ve been up to since they smashed open that mysterious door...
You know what your adventure needs, %PLAYERNAME%? A new buddy! I spoke with a colleague and was able to orchestrate a little surprise for you.
These Pokémon are the first partner Pokémon offered to Trainers in the Johto region. Go on—pick one!
I think that’s a great Pokémon, too, %PLAYERNAME%!
Chikorita, the Leaf Pokémon, is docile and loves to soak up the sun’s rays. A sweet aroma gently wafts from the leaf on its head. Doesn’t it have just the most adorable face?
Cyndaquil, the Fire Mouse Pokémon, is timid and always curls itself up in a ball. If attacked, it flares up its back for protection. Doesn’t its shyness make you want to cuddle it even more?
Totodile, the Big Jaw Pokémon, is small but rough and tough. It won’t hesitate to take a bite out of anything that moves. Though what’s the harm in one quick pet...
I’m sure this little one is eager to spend some time with you, and what better way than letting it join you on your Johto-inspired journey!
Wow, your Chikorita evolved into Bayleef already! And just in time, %PLAYERNAME%—I have some troubling news.
Wow, your Cyndaquil evolved into Quilava already! And just in time, %PLAYERNAME%—I have some troubling news.
Wow, your Totodile evolved into Croconaw already! And just in time, %PLAYERNAME%—I have some troubling news.
Team GO Rocket is mobilizing—and they’re headed straight toward us!
I have a feeling they’re stirring up more than just a mild bit of mischief... That must be why they’re launching an invasion—more distractions! Not to mention they always love to crash our parties.
Have they heard about the Celebi sightings? Or maybe they have something even more sinister up their sleeve...
I’m going to need your help defeating some Team GO Rocket Grunts—distract the distraction, and buy me some time to investigate. Can I count on your help?
Magnificent work, %PLAYERNAME%! While I was investigating, some Team GO Rocket Grunts ran by, whining about losing to an “unfairly strong Trainer.”
I assume you’re the Trainer in question? Haha, but of course! I knew I could trust you.
So, my sleuthing turned up an interesting rumor. A Gyarados has been spotted nearby, but it isn’t at all like your typical Gyarados.
This one seems like it’s mired in a fit of rage—not unlike a certain Red Gyarados that once rampaged the Johto region’s Lake of Rage.
Back then, Team Rocket used a mysterious radio broadcast to force Magikarp to evolve.
Hm. That sounds similar to Shadow Pokémon, don’t you think? And there have been a lot more Shadow Pokémon appearing lately. Could Team GO Rocket be using the same technology again?
And is this connected to what they stole from behind the mysterious door? What if it was some sort of power that they’ve now amplified and corrupted...?
And with Celebi about and its time travel powers— Egad! Who knows what Team GO Rocket could do! There’s no time to waste. Let’s save Gyarados and then set our sights on finding Celebi before it’s too late!
Great work, %PLAYERNAME%! That Gyarados is much calmer now that you’ve rescued it from Team GO Rocket.
It looks like Team GO Rocket’s retreating as well, so how about we continue with our festivities? They’ve stolen enough of our time.
I think your Bayleef would like to play with you!
I think your Quilava would like to play with you!
I think your Croconaw would like to play with you!
Even in the direst of situations, when you’re pulled from all sides, it’s essential to take time to decompress and enjoy a peaceful moment with your friends.
Times like that give us the strength to persevere.
Speaking of strength, your Bayleef looks ready to evolve!
Speaking of strength, your Quilava looks ready to evolve!
Speaking of strength, your Croconaw looks ready to evolve!
Ah, your Meganium is absolutely efflorescent with happiness! Are you two having fun? It’s been a delight to see your friendship blossom.
Ah, your Typhlosion is absolutely ablaze with happiness! Are you two having fun? It’s been a delight to see your new friendship burn so brightly.
Ah, your Feraligatr is absolutely awash with happiness! Are you two having fun? It’s been a delight to experience the refreshing friendship between you two.
Making new friends and exploring the world around you are two of life’s greatest joys. My life is richer for the adventures I’ve had.
I’d have never found that mysterious door if not for a random adventure! Despite Team GO Rocket’s interference, I’m still grateful for the time I got to spend with the team leaders and the research I was able to do.
Enough of my chatter—why don’t you go make some new friends yourself? There’s plenty of day left to enjoy.
%PLAYERNAME%, sorry to rush you, but we have to hurry! There’s been a confirmed Celebi sighting just moments ago. If you go now, you might be able to catch it!
Let’s GO!
Great work catching Celebi! It is thought that so long as Celebi appears, a bright and shining future awaits us.
I wonder why Celebi decided to appear to us today. Maybe it’s a sign of good things to come.
After all the trouble we’ve had with Team GO Rocket, I welcome the reminder that peaceful times aren’t too far off.
While you were out, I uncovered the truth Team GO Rocket has been trying so hard to hide: they’ve captured Lugia and Ho-Oh.
It gets worse: using the power they stole from behind the mysterious door in conjunction with radio technology developed via their past broadcasts, they’ve forced Lugia and Ho-Oh to ascend to a level of power beyond any Shadow Pokémon we’ve ever seen.
They’re calling them Apex Shadow Lugia and Apex Shadow Ho-Oh. Get ready, %PLAYERNAME%—the battle’s only just begun.
Well hello, %PLAYERNAME%! How’d you enjoy yesterday’s festivities? I hope you’re still feeling energetic, because there’s more in store—and this time, we’re focusing on the Kanto region!
What better place to start one’s Pokémon adventure, no?
Now, let’s get out there and start exploring!
Ah, %PLAYERNAME%, you’re looking a bit tired. Why not take a quick break? Play with your buddy a bit, maybe feed it a nice juicy Berry?
While you’re at it, why not grab a snack yourself! Even the strongest Trainers can’t run on an empty stomach.
Having fun, %PLAYERNAME%? Are you all warmed up for your next adventure? I hope so, because you’ll soon be exploring the area’s different habitats.
There are five habitats, each filled with unique Pokémon. Which habitats have which Pokémon, you ask? Well, let’s go find out!
Nice snapshots, %PLAYERNAME%! You really captured the essence of the Pokémon, and it looks like the little models were having a good time, too.
Did you enjoy your excursion through the habitats? I bet you encountered an immense amount of Pokémon, both familiar and new to you!
There are tons of amazing Trainers out here exploring as well.
Why not make a few new friends, then trade or battle with them?
Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! While you were out, I heard that a powerful Legendary Pokémon has been sighted in the area.
Maybe it heard about our festivities and wanted to join the fun? Let’s go check it out!
Whoa! Is that...Mewtwo? Incredible! Will the world’s wonders never cease?
This has been such a fun day, %PLAYERNAME%. I hope you enjoy the rest of your adventure—there’s still plenty more to do. Until next time...let’s GO!

Starry Skies (1/4)
%PLAYERNAME%, great timing!
I just got back from a harrowing expedition. I’ll spare you the gritty details, but it involved boulders, quicksand, and lots of Venipede.
Anyway, I’ve come out on the other side with some exciting treasures: fossils, King’s Rocks, and a trove of maps!
It’s hard to determine who or what left the maps behind, especially given their contents. For example, this one apparently leads to “the world’s tastiest Poffin.”
There was one in particular that caught my eye: a map of the skies showing the exact position of the stars today!
It made me wonder if this is a purely informational map, or if it points toward something special.
What do you say we find out together?
Seeing as the stars are our inspiration, how about we focus on either diurnal Pokémon—meaning Pokémon that are active during the day—or their opposite, nocturnal Pokémon?
Take some time to think about which Pokémon you’re more interested in researching. Once you’ve decided, we can set off!
Starry Skies (2/4)
Great choice! There’s nothing like a warm sunbeam to refresh a tired body!
Speaking of which, here’s a refreshing Pokémon fact: the leaves on Petilil’s head are highly valued for medicinal purposes. They provide relief from weariness—even more so when boiled.
Heh. Now I’m in the mood to look for some Grass-type Pokémon. Shall we, %PLAYERNAME%?
Great choice! I always enjoy a stroll in the cool, crisp moonlight.
Speaking of which, here’s a cool Pokémon fact: Misdreavus conceals itself in darkness, sending chills up travelers’ spines with its childlike weeping.
Spooky, eh? Now I’m in the mood to look for some Ghost-type Pokémon. Shall we, %PLAYERNAME%?
Starry Skies (3/4)
Ah, %PLAYERNAME%.
It has been some time since we last spoke. Have you been faring well?
Splendid. Are you out doing research for Professor Willow?
I, too, find the cycles of the sun and moon fascinating.
But I am here for a different matter. I have picked up readings that indicate the presence of something from beyond this world.
I had hoped to request your company, but your research for Professor Willow comes first.
I see. So you‘ve both been moved to study Pokémon associated with daytime after finding a celestial chart.
This is farewell for now. I hope you and your Buddy Pokémon have a radiant day, %PLAYERNAME%.
I see. So you‘ve both been moved to study Pokémon associated with nighttime after finding a celestial chart.
This is farewell for now, %PLAYERNAME%. I hope you have a fruitful day—or should I say night?—learning about Pokémon.
Starry Skies (4/4)
Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! How did it go?
You ran into Rhi? They just stopped by to chat with me, too!
Rhi was hot on the heels of something otherworldly. We were getting ready to rally the Team Leaders when—get this—a Cosmog blissfully bobbed by!
You don’t see that every day.
I recall Rhi mentioning that Cosmog’s gaseous body can be blown away by the slightest breeze, but it doesn’t seem to care.
Even so, we can’t just leave it be. You’d better hurry and catch that Cosmog before it blows into some trouble!
While you’re doing that, I’ll ponder how another Cosmog found its way here...and whether it was more than luck that we happened to have a map of the stars on this exact day.
Mysteries to illuminate in the future, as Rhi might say!
Which would you rather research: Pokémon that appear during the daytime or Pokémon that appear at night?

%PLAYERNAME%! Perfect timing.
I was just settling in to read the latest edition of Pokémon Researcher’s Weekly when I saw a couple of Team GO Rocket Grunts run by.
We should go after them before they get up to anything too dastardly.
*sigh* It looks like my reading will have to wait. I’ll head this way, and you go that way!
From the Shadows (2/5)
Phew! That was a bit of a workout, eh, %PLAYERNAME%?
But I’ll bet you took on that Grunt without breaking a sweat!
And, as usual, I’ll bet they abandoned some poor Pokémon in their wake...
How sad. The least we can do is purify some of these Pokémon.
They’ll have a much happier future with you, %PLAYERNAME%.
From the Shadows (3/5)
Thanks for purifying those Pokémon!
They’re looking so cheerful—I’m sure they see you as their hero!
I know I do, but we can’t rest just yet. We need to stop Team GO Rocket at their source—the leaders.
Let’s get cracking on tracking down those nefarious nuisances!
From the Shadows (4/5)
Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%!
You made short work of those Team GO Rocket Leaders.
That’s no easy feat. Well, maybe it is for someone like you!
If only they could change their ways permanently... But until they do, we’ll be around to prevent them from doing anything too troublesome.
And that means showing their boss who’s boss.
Challenge the Team GO Rocket Boss Giovanni, %PLAYERNAME%!
From the Shadows (5/5)
Back so soon, %PLAYERNAME%? You’re really not giving Team GO Rocket any time to rest!
And that’s just the way it should be—all in the name of keeping Pokémon everywhere safe.
Thanks for your help, %PLAYERNAME%. Until the next time we need to foil their plans!
From the Shadows
A Shadowy Disturbance (1/5)
I’m sure I left them around here somewhere...
Oh, hey, %PLAYERNAME%!
You haven’t seen my earplugs, have you? Those Team GO Rocket Grunts over there have been blasting music at higher volume than a Loudred all day!
What’s more, I’ve barely been able to walk two steps without the crinkling of littered candy wrappers underfoot.
And do you see all the bright red Rs they’ve spray-painted around here?
I’m all for a good party, but theirs has been a real nuisance.
Could you have a chat with those Grunts while I clean things up, %PLAYERNAME%?
A Shadowy Disturbance (2/5)
How did it go, %PLAYERNAME%? Did you have a calm, reasonable discussion with those Team GO Rocket Grunts?
No? They just started battling you? *sigh* I guess that’s to be expected.
Well, thanks for getting them to quiet down all the same! I can finally hear myself think again.
And what I’m thinking is, there’s no way those rambunctious Grunts would settle down so easily. I’m positive they’ll come back before long.
Could you “chat” with them again if you see them, please?
A Shadowy Disturbance (3/5)
Well done, %PLAYERNAME%!
You defeated them so quickly, it almost makes ME want to start a party!
But it’ll have to wait, because right as those Grunts scampered away, I overheard them muttering about coming back bigger, louder, and wilder than ever.
We can’t have them disturbing the local Pokémon—to say nothing of the assault on my eardrums!
Let’s put in a complaint with their superiors, shall we? Defeat the Team GO Rocket Leaders!
A Shadowy Disturbance (4/5)
Great work, %PLAYERNAME%!
You’ve won us some peace and quiet, but I think we should make certain Team GO Rocket isn’t planning any more mischief.
And that means taking down their boss, Giovanni!
I know you can do it!
A Shadowy Disturbance (5/5)
Expertly done, %PLAYERNAME%!
Good news on my end—Meltan and I are just about finished picking up all the litter Team GO Rocket left behind.
Thanks for your help today. We should throw our own party to celebrate your success!
Just...at a reasonable volume. And we’ll pick up after ourselves, of course.
I’ll see you again soon, %PLAYERNAME%!
A Shadowy Disturbance
Let’s GO! (1/6)
Hey, %PLAYERNAME%!
Things are pretty calm right now, aren’t they? The Pidove are chirping, the Hoppip are floating...
It makes me want to take a big stretch and go on a nice walk.
You’ve got to savor peaceful days like these, especially considering that Pokémon research can be fraught with all sorts of mystery and danger! Just, well, not today.
But no matter the circumstances, I know you’re looking out for Pokémon everywhere—and for me! In fact, I’ve always thought of you as my hero when I’m in a pinch.
On a relaxing day like this, you deserve a change of pace from our grand adventures. It’s a perfect time to take a look at what’s going on in our own backyard.
Could you check out the Pokémon in the area for me, %PLAYERNAME%?
Let’s GO! (2/6)
Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! Let’s look at those Pokémon...
You’ve already powered some of them up, I see. Staying prepared in case any dangers arise? Great work, as usual!
With Trainers like you around, even forces like Team GO Rocket can be defeated. Speaking of which, something seems especially sinister about them lately. Just my Pokémon Professor’s intuition.
Hmm. Well, I’ll keep noodling on that. Could be my intuition is oversensitive lately. Let’s just enjoy this peace while we can!
I’m going to review some of my older observations. Why don’t you leave some of those Pokémon with me and see what other Pokémon pals are around?
Let’s GO! (3/6)
Thank goodness, %PLAYERNAME%! You came back just in time! You and your new Pokémon are urgently needed!
Something...something’s happened! Something big!
You see...
...I’ve just set up lunch plans with an old friend that I can’t miss.
Haha, sorry for winding you up there! I know you’d never miss a chance to jump in and save the day.
I’ve got a feeling my friend will have some valuable insight into my observations, so I need to collect my notes. I’ll tell you all about our discussion when I get back.
Actually, I could use your help with something—while I look for those notes, could you keep an eye on the team leaders in case they need anything? I bet they could use a hero of their own!
I’m sure you’ll hear from them soon, %PLAYERNAME%. Until then, let’s...hope I can find my notes!
Let’s GO! (4/6)
Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! I don’t have anything juicy for you right now. Have you checked in on the team leaders lately?
Let’s GO! (5/6)
Let’s GO! (6/6)
What do you think of THAT, %PLAYERNAME%? Pretty snazzy, isn’t it?
You can’t buy that anywhere. Master Balls were developed by Silph Co. and aren’t easy to come by.
I’ve heard they’re the very best Poké Ball out there—it’ll catch any wild Pokémon without fail! I know you’ll think carefully about when to use it.
Now for the bad news. Have you seen Team GO Rocket in front of Gyms today?
They’ve found a way to take over Gyms with Shadow Pokémon.
With so many Gyms under their control, who knows what trouble they’ll cause if left unchecked.
%PLAYERNAME%, I need your help. Please take on the Shadow Pokémon in those Gyms wherever and whenever you find them.
And who knows? With everything you do for Pokémon and other Trainers, you may have an opportunity to get your hands on another Master Ball someday.
But for now, get out there and be the hero I know you are!
%PLAYERNAME%! I’ve been looking all over for you!
I heard about your heroics with the team leaders. I couldn’t be happier that you all have been spending so much quality time together.
I hope you’ve enjoyed getting to know them better, too!
But there’s another reason I’m glad you’re here.
The team leaders have noticed Team GO Rocket acting even MORE suspicious lately.
And so have I. Remember that meeting I was preparing to attend? It was with Silph Co., a large company in the Kanto region.
They’ve had issues with villainous organizations in the past, and I was curious if they’d had any trouble recently.
Have you heard of Silph Co.? They develop and manufacture useful tools and items—including Poké Balls—that are distributed all over.
Unfortunately, they didn’t have any answers about Team GO Rocket. But there’s some good news!
I have a gift for you, courtesy of Silph Co. I’ll be right back, just as soon...as I remember...where I put it...
Let’s GO!
